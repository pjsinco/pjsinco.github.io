        <h1>What will the Chicago Bears do with the No. 1 draft pick? Brad Biggs’ 10 thoughts after the finale of a 3-14 season.</h1>
        <p>Jan 08, 2023 at 10:24 pm</p>

        <p>10 thoughts after the Chicago Bears reached the end of the teardown phase for general manager Ryan Poles, losing to the Minnesota Vikings 29-13 on Sunday at Soldier Field to close the season at 3-14 and on a club-record 10-game losing streak.</p>

        <h2>1. As Bears players were filtering into the locker room, the Houston Texans were putting the finishing touches on an improbable rally in Indianapolis.</h2>

        <p>A Bears fan wearing a costume bear head and no shirt celebrates a field goal in the fourth quarter against the Vikings at Soldier Field on Jan. 8, 2023.</p>

        <p>Facing fourth-and-20 from the Colts 28-yard line in the final minute, Texans quarterback Davis Mills backed up to the 40 and heaved a pass to the end zone that went through the hands of leaping Colts cornerback Rodney Thomas II and right to tight end Jordan Akins for a touchdown. Mills then connected with Akins for a 2-point conversion, and like that, the Texans won 32-31, delivering the Bears the No. 1 pick in the draft and dropping Houston to No. 2.</p>

        <p>I can’t recall something this wacky in the battle to the bottom for the top pick. The Texans led 24-14 until the final minute of the third quarter. Things looked pretty good for the Bears to secure the top pick as they struggled to move the ball with Nathan Peterman and Tim Boyle playing quarterback in place of Justin Fields.</p>

        <p>Then the Colts scored 17 unanswered points to lead 31-24 with a little more than three minutes remaining. Lovie Smith’s Texans chose the high road, battled to the end and wound up winning to improve to 3-13-1, a half-game better than the Bears.</p>

        <p>The Bears now own the No. 1 pick for the first time since 1947 and head into the offseason with more than $115 million in salary-cap space. I don’t believe this is how general manager Ryan Poles and his staff, along with coach Matt Eberflus, drew it up last winter and spring as they were getting situated in their roles and planning for the 2022 season. You don’t go into a year figuring you will be 32nd out of 32 teams.</p>

        <p>They were looking to establish their program, turn an older roster into a younger one, get the cap situation straightened out and discover building blocks for the future. Most pegged the Bears as a five- or six-win team. The schedule was supposed to be much more favorable, or at least that’s how it looked back in the spring when you considered how their opponents finished in 2021. What was projected to be the eighth-easiest schedule turned out to be the most difficult in the league.</p>

        <p>[ [Don’t miss] Chicago Bears — with an assist from Lovie Smith — leave their season-ending loss with a reason to celebrate: the No. 1 draft pick ]</p>

        <p>There’s a long offseason ahead to dissect how many building blocks Poles and Eberflus uncovered and how much better those players can be in 2023 with improved talent around them.</p>

        <p>Offensive coordinator Luke Getsy and quarterbacks coach Andrew Janocko spoke in the last few days about the work ahead for Fields, who had a season filled with highlight-reel moments leading the league’s No. 1 rushing offense. There were big throws from time to time, but the Bears readily admit their offensive formula for this season isn’t meant for sustainable success.</p>

        <p>There is optimism Fields can be a more dynamic player after a busy offseason for Poles and his staff. You will hear time and again between now and September how Fields’ third season will be critical for his future. That will be the No. 1 story at Halas Hall next season, and that’s why it’s so fascinating what the Bears will do with the No. 1 pick in addition to how Poles approaches free agency. If Fields was set up to fail in 2022, he has to be given a chance to thrive in 2023.</p>

        <p>Last January, a realistic look at the Bears told you there was a long road ahead to relevancy. That’s why I asked Poles and Eberflus at their introductory news conference about the length of the contracts Chairman George McCaskey gave them. That question is still pertinent because, as we’ve seen, this is a complete overhaul and the easy part — swinging the sledgehammer and taking the parts you ripped down out to the dumpster — is over.</p>

        <p>Bears coach Matt Eberflus walks off the field after a 29-13 loss to the Vikings at Soldier Field on Jan. 8, 2023.</p>

        <p>The acumen of Poles and his staff is what we all will be watching and evaluating now. How is that going to look?</p>

        <p>“High confidence, no question,” Eberflus said. “The first thing of a personnel manager is the ability to pick players, and he can do that. The place where he came from (the Kansas City Chiefs), he has shown that this year already and we look at the guys the same way. We like long, lean, fast, physical players. We’re excited about getting that going.”</p>

        <p>Everyone has a slightly different take, but the overriding feeling I get from the fan base is that the Bears have wrapped up one of the most positive three-win seasons in recent NFL history. Optimism abounds, and if Fields takes major strides forward, that will be the biggest piece. But the roster has holes all over the place.</p>

        <p>I imagine Poles’ primary goal will be to overhaul the lines on both sides of the ball, and that’s what a veteran personnel man I chatted with Thursday said.</p>

        <p>“Knowing that you’re not going to rebuild this thing in one year, I would spend a lot of resources on the fronts,” he said. “And then try to hit on some skill guys late in the draft. You’re much more likely to find skill in the fourth through seventh rounds than you are to find legit O-line and D-line guys.</p>

        <p>“I still believe in building out from the lines. The analytics have crept in, a priority is put on skill and receivers and I get all of that, but in Chicago and the way they are going to have to win games and the games they play in crappy weather, I would build it inside-out.”</p>

        <p>The challenge is finding a mix of free agents and draft picks to add, and when we get to mid-March, the free-agent class might look like a department store that’s sold out of many in-demand items.</p>

        <p>[ [Don’t miss] Chicago Bears have had only 2 No. 1 draft picks in team history — and both were disappointing ]</p>

        <p>“You’ve gotten some contract extensions in the last couple weeks and you’re always going to have four to eight franchise-tag guys, and it’s a bad class for free agency to begin with,” the scout said. “You get down past all that and then what’s left? Anybody that is good character in this market, they’re going to get re-signed by their own club or get franchised.</p>

        <p>“There might be a few that squeak through, and in the world they’re going to live in, everyone makes such a big deal about having a ton of cap space — it’s not always the best thing. All you’re going to do is overpay a ton of guys.”</p>

        <p>The scout called the projected group of free-agent wide receivers the worst he ever has seen. Unless Odell Beckham Jr., who has torn the same ACL twice, wants to join a rebuilding offense, the best wide receiver available might be Jakobi Meyers of the New England Patriots.</p>

        <p>“I actually like Chase Claypool better than Jakobi Meyers,” the scout said.</p>

        <p>Circling back to the lines, I chatted with an assistant GM and he praised the Bears for rolling with fifth-round pick Braxton Jones at left tackle this season. He liked Jones in the pre-draft process and used the word “intentional” in describing what the Bears did by thrusting young players such as Jones into primary roles. More on Jones in a little bit, but this guy’s take was that the Bears will look to make some moves in free agency but that Poles will be draft-driven in working to climb out of the hole in the NFC North.</p>

        <p>“Things can turn quickly in the NFL, faster than you think at times,” he said. “They might not be good next season, but sometimes things can flip in a hurry.”</p>

        <p>The hard work is just beginning.</p>

        <h2>2. What to do with the No. 1 pick?</h2>

        <p>Alabama linebacker Will Anderson Jr. plays on Sept. 3, 2022, in Tuscaloosa, Ala.</p>

        <p>It will be one of the most repeated questions in the pre-draft season, which is almost as long and grueling as the regular season. The first option, of course, is to take a marquee player at the top of the draft and hope he is an impact player from Day 1.</p>

        <p>The top two picks last year were Travon Walker, whom the Jacksonville Jaguars are using at outside linebacker, and Detroit Lions defensive end Aidan Hutchinson. Walker had 3½ sacks, 10 quarterback hits, one interception and one forced fumble. Hutchinson finished with 9½ sacks, 15 QB hits and three interceptions.</p>

        <p>“You can argue both (Alabama edge rusher Will Anderson and Georgia defensive tackle Jalen Carter) are more talented,” a college scouting director told me. “Hutchinson’s calling card was his effort and his motor and all that stuff. He was a shorter-arm guy; there’s going to be some limitations. And then Walker was a huge projection. You’re drafting the athlete. When I went there, I’m like, ‘Is he a five-technique? Is he an outside linebacker?’ Ton of talent but a ton of projection.</p>

        <p>“The two guys this year, you know exactly what they are. Jalen Carter is as talented of a human being as you will find. The problem is that he’s not a character guy and there is a major bust factor with D-linemen that don’t have great character. There’s risk there but a lot of teams are willing to take it.</p>

        <p>“Will Anderson is not like a (Nick) Bosa or a Chase Young in terms of his get-off or his bend. He is just an ass kicker. He is a fighter. He’s tougher than hell. He is the alpha in a locker room that is all alphas. He’s the lead dog.</p>

        <p>“They’re all different. These two guys, I think it’s a little clearer than last year in those top two defensive guys. This year has got three quarterbacks. That is the rub there.”</p>

        <p>[ [Don’t miss] Alabama’s Bryce Young and Will Anderson declare for the NFL draft — and either could be the No. 1 pick ]</p>

        <p>Carter did not flash in the College Football Playoff semifinal victory over Ohio State. He looked a little heavy and wasn’t explosive. Personnel men I have spoken to are intrigued by Carter but say there’s a lot of work to do to learn more about him.</p>

        <p>For those wondering what Poles could turn the No. 1 pick into in terms of a trade, that’s where the quarterbacks come into play. From Nos. 2 through 9 in the draft order, a bunch of teams will be in the market for a quarterback. There will be veteran movement with guys such as Derek Carr, Jimmy Garoppolo and others. Tom Brady, anyone? But the Texans (No. 2), Colts (4), Seattle Seahawks (5), Lions (6), Las Vegas Raiders (7), Atlanta Falcons (8) and Carolina Panthers (9th) all could be interested in drafting a quarterback.</p>

        <p>The Lions probably were encouraged by Jared Goff this season and might look to use that pick to help a porous defense. The Seahawks could re-sign Geno Smith. Maybe one or two of those teams goes for a veteran. Still, that leaves a handful of teams in need of a quarterback. Want to have the top choice at the position? Probably need to get ahead of the Texans, right?</p>

        <p>Alabama quarterback Bryce Young warms up before a game against LSU Tigers on Nov. 5, 2022, in Baton Rouge, La.</p>

        <p>A lot of mock drafts have linked the Texans to Alabama quarterback Bryce Young for months. The Crimson Tide website lists him at 6 feet, 194 pounds. Multiple scouts I spoke with said the buzz in NFL circles is Young is probably closer to 185 pounds. That would make him an absolute outlier as an NFL prospect. Teams have charts to measure the size of prospects — height, weight, length, hand size.</p>

        <p>“He wouldn’t even be on our graph at that size,” one scout said of his team’s chart for quarterback height and weight.</p>

        <p>How much of an outlier would Young be at 185 pounds? Or even 194? According to Pro Football Reference, three quarterbacks who weighed 210 or less have been drafted in the first round since 2000.</p>

        <p>Kyler Murray, Arizona Cardinals, No. 1, 5-10, 207</p>
        <p>Johnny Manziel, Cleveland Browns, No. 22, 6-0, 207</p>
        <p>Michael Vick, Falcons, No. 1, 6-0, 210</p>
        <p>“I think the Kentucky kid, Will Levis, is the top quarterback,” the scouting director said. “He’s 6-foot-3. He’s almost 240. He’s got a huge arm. His mental makeup is top of the line. I think he’s going to be a good pro.</p>

        <p>“Is Bryce Young a better player? More exciting? Absolutely. But he’s just not built. I think the Kentucky kid has the build, the strength and athleticism to not only avoid hits but take hits and be able to survive a 17-game season and have the arm strength to play in any kind of weather. I think he is the safest pick in terms of quarterbacks.”</p>

        <p>Young is intriguing, and scouts say he will get top marks for intangibles, playmaking ability and performance in clutch situations. He’s everything NFL teams are seeking in that regard. But Young’s size — he has a slender frame, so it’s not like he can get a lot bigger — would require whatever team chooses him to take a leap of faith.</p>

        <p>Some smart football folks have told me that when considering a quarterback from a college program that isn’t high-profile, you have to ask whether that player elevated his school to a level it hadn’t reached in a long time. Is that a fair question for Levis, who had some injuries this past season at Kentucky?</p>

        <p>[ [Don’t miss] Column: After a 10th straight loss, the Chicago Bears are No. 1 — in the NFL draft. Now the real work begins. ]</p>

        <p>“Would you say Josh Allen did that at Wyoming?” the scouting director responded. “He was a 58% completion guy, or whatever it was, and he didn’t light the world on fire. What he had was NFL talent, athleticism, size, strength, mental capacity, all that stuff. I think you need to factor it in a little bit and you can use that to help reduce the risk, but I don’t think that needs to be a factor where you say, ‘I’m not drafting that guy because he didn’t turn Kentucky into a top-10 team.’ Hell, Patrick Mahomes wasn’t taking Texas Tech to high-profile bowl games, was he?”</p>

        <p>Ohio State’s C.J. Stroud is the third top quarterback prospect. There are concerns about how he operates in the pocket, and he traditionally has not been great outside of the pocket. Yes, Stroud was terrific in the loss to Georgia, but the multiple scouts I chatted with all had him third in their evaluation. Of course, it takes only one team to fall in love with a player and have conviction.</p>

        <p>The first rule — and it’s true almost every year — is quarterbacks go early and they’re almost always overdrafted. Draft season will provide an extended period to evaluate them and the rest of the prospects.</p>

        <h2>3. Braxton Jones finished the season as the only offensive player on the field for every snap.</h2>

        <p>Bears offensive tackle Braxton Jones walks off the field after a failed drive in the first quarter against the Lions at Ford Field on Jan. 1, 2023.</p>

        <p>It’s a terrific accomplishment for the rookie, especially when considering how injuries rocked the offensive line for much of the season. Jones took a brief trip to the blue medical tent during Sunday’s game to have his hand inspected but didn’t miss any action. It’s notable the team didn’t have a single defensive player on the field for every snap, so, again, kudos to Jones for his durability.</p>

        <p>All of that playing time exposed Jones to just about everything a left tackle can see in the NFL. It’s possible the Bears believe Jones, with a strong offseason in the weight room and hard work on the field, can take steps forward to become the kind of player the team needs at the position. There is clearly more upside to him.</p>

        <p>Jones had games that went by quietly, always a good thing for a lineman, and others in which he looked overmatched, like last week’s loss in Detroit. That’s going to happen for first- and fifth-round picks, and considering where Jones was drafted, it’s fair to call his season a success.</p>

        <p>The Bears will conduct a thorough review of all players and positions. My hunch is they will try to provide Jones with competition for the starting job next season, something a couple of notches above signing 33-year-old Riley Reiff just before training camp. That’s not meant as a knock on Reiff, who wound up being serviceable at right tackle and provided value in the meeting room for young players. He was this year’s version of Jason Peters.</p>

        <p>[ [Don’t miss] Chicago Bears finish 3-14 — that’s the most losses in franchise history. Here’s how the 2022 season unfolded. ]</p>

        <p>But if you’re going to talk about making the offensive line a strength, a discussion needs to begin at the premier position. There’s one option who could reach free agency — and the Bears might be able to send a Brinks truck to bring him to Halas Hall: Chiefs left tackle Orlando Brown. It’s possible Kansas City signs him to a new contract or uses the franchise tag for a second year. Brown played on the tag for $16.6 million this season, and that figure will bump to nearly $20 million in 2023.</p>

        <p>Brown rejected a five-year, $95 million extension in the offseason because of how the proposed deal was structured. Ryan Poles and Bears co-director of personnel Trey Koziol know the ins and outs of Brown from their time in Kansas City, and a relationship might aid the Bears in pursuit of the player. Again, Brown would have to reach free agency, and the Chiefs, who are projected to be 14th in available salary-cap space according to spotrac.com, likely will be motivated to retain him.</p>

        <p>The Green Bay Packers already extended versatile offensive lineman Elgton Jenkins and the Browns re-upped right tackle Jack Conklin, preventing them from becoming coveted free agents. If the Bears cannot sign a plug-and-play left tackle in free agency, then you’re looking at the possibility of a high draft pick at the position or the hope that Jones gets stronger.</p>

        <h2>4. A striking statistic from the season was that the Bears finished minus-37 in sack differential.</h2>

        <p>Bears quarterback Justin Fields is helped up after being sacked in the third quarter on Dec. 18, 2022, at Soldier Field. </p>
        <p>Bears quarterback Justin Fields is helped up after being sacked in the third quarter on Dec. 18, 2022, at Soldier Field. (Brian Cassella / Chicago Tribune)</p>
        <p>According to WBBM-AM 780 statistical wiz Doug Colletti, the Bears are the first team since 1995 with 55 or more sacks allowed (57) and fewer than 22 sacks (20).</p>

        <p>More concerning is this was a historically bad passing offense in an era when you have to be able to throw the ball to win. Any way you slice it, the passing game was bad, and blame is shared by everyone — Justin Fields, the three other quarterbacks who played two games, the offensive line and the wide receivers, who struggled. Some take this as a criticism of Fields. Hardly. It’s an evaluation of the unit as a whole.</p>

        <p>This wasn’t just the 32nd-ranked passing offense this season. It was one of the worst in a long stretch. Since 1994, five teams have averaged less than 130.5 passing yards per game, where the Bears finished (starters in parentheses):</p>

        <p>2009: Browns (Brady Quinn, Derek Anderson), 129.8</p>
        <p>2005: San Francisco 49ers (Alex Smith, Tim Rattay, Ken Dorsey, Cody Pickett), 118.7</p>
        <p>2005: Bears (Kyle Orton), 125.1</p>
        <p>2000: Cincinnati Bengals (Akili Smith, Scott Mitchell), 121.6</p>
        <p>1999: Philadelphia Eagles (Donovan McNabb, Doug Pederson, Koy Detmer), 130.3</p>
        <p>Since 1990, five teams have been at or below 13.1 completions per game, where the Bears finished:</p>

        <p>2009: New York Jets (Mark Sanchez, Kellen Clemens), 13.1</p>
        <p>2005: 49ers, 12.8</p>
        <p>2001: Dallas Cowboys (Quincy Carter, Anthony Wright, Ryan Leaf, Clint Stoerner), 13.1</p>
        <p>2000: Bengals, 12.9</p>
        <p>1990: Raiders, (Jay Schroeder) 11.4</p>
        <p>Since the NFL went to a 16-game schedule in 1978, two teams have averaged less than 22.2 pass attempts:</p>

        <p>1990: Raiders, 21.0</p>
        <p>1978: Bears (Bob Avellini, Mike Phipps), 22.0</p>
        <p>The Bears have to be miles better throwing the football to get where they want to go. It will require new personnel on the line, and somehow, some way, Ryan Poles has to infuse the wide receiver room with improved talent. Fields has to be better, too, or the Bears offense will spin its wheels in mediocrity.</p>

        <h2>5. A league source indicated the Bears are not expected to send their coaching staff to the East-West Shrine Bowl later this month to coach during the week and in the Feb. 2 game.</h2>

        <p>Bears coach Matt Eberflus, center left, and offensive coordinator Luke Getsy, center right, work from the sideline in the first quarter against the Vikings at Soldier Field on Jan. 8, 2023.</p>

        <p>The NFL is rotating sending full coaching staffs to the East-West and the Senior Bowl beginning this year, and the Bears, with the No. 1 pick, were in position to be one of the two teams selected. Typically the two teams highest in the draft order that do not hire a new coaching staff are invited.</p>

        <p>With Lovie Smith getting fired in Houston late Sunday and other teams having already fired their coaches — or potentially waiting to do so Monday — it will be interesting to see which staffs are invited. The Raiders might be one. Just speculation on my part.</p>

        <p>[ [Don’t miss] Developer unveils video tour of ‘reimagined’ domed Soldier Field in ‘Hail Mary’ bid to keep Bears in Chicago ]</p>

        <p>[ [Don’t miss] Will the Chicago Bears leave Soldier Field for Arlington Heights? Here’s what to know. ]</p>

        <p>The Bears coaching staff has been going full speed for nearly a year now since Matt Eberflus assembled it and will need to complete season evaluations before getting vacation time. When the coaches return, the team is expected to dive into preparation for free agency, which will be a busy period with roster needs almost across the board and more than $100 million in available cap space.</p>

        <p>By skipping a week in Las Vegas for the East-West, the Bears will not interrupt that process and can transition into preparing for the scouting combine and college pro days.</p>

        <p>It makes sense, especially because the Senior Bowl assembled a stronger roster of players as usual. Last year 106 players who participated in the Senior Bowl were drafted and 45 had their names called in the first three rounds. Six were selected in the first round.</p>

        <p>The East-West put together a better game than usual last year as 45 players were drafted — a 55% uptick over the number drafted from the 2021 game. Patriots wide receiver Tyquan Thornton was a second-round pick, the highest selection of an East-West player since the Patriots chose quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo in the second round in 2012. But the Senior Bowl will have more talent to evaluate for the first two days of the draft (Rounds 1-3).</p>

        <p>The NFL has partnered with the East-West to add some synergy to the week in Las Vegas, which will host the Pro Bowl Games at the same time. Full NFL staffs will coach in the Senior Bowl in 2024. The Bears last coached in the Senior Bowl in 2017.</p>

        <h2>6. Evaluating offensive line play is a difficult task.</h2>

        <p>Grading players is guesswork when you don’t know the specific protection assignment on any given play. On occasion it’s obvious to anyone viewing where the blame lies. But more often than not, there is some gray involved. A full understanding requires knowing what the quarterback’s progression was and how the receivers executed their routes.</p>

        <p>You don’t need various rankings or grades to know the Bears were very poor in protecting Justin Fields and the other quarterbacks. What struck me back in July was when Ross Tucker, who has a network of podcasts and does work for CBS Sports, Audacy and Westwood One, stacked up the league’s 32 offensive lines and had the Bears last.</p>

        <p>“The Bears have the potential to not only have the worst offensive line in the NFL this year but maybe even the worst offensive line we’ve seen in the NFL in quite some time if their young tackles don’t come through,” Tucker wrote.</p>

        <p>[ [Don’t miss] How do the 2022 Chicago Bears compare with the worst teams in franchise history? A look at some of the ‘darkest and dreariest’ years. ]</p>

        <p>During the first week of training camp, I reached out to Tucker, who is always entertaining and informative. If you haven’t seen his #tuckspreads on social media, it’s amusing as he travels to pro and college stadiums. He’s a former offensive lineman, so he has a pretty good idea of what he’s looking at in the trenches — and he’s not a hot-take artist. Tucker gives you a measured take and works tirelessly to follow the entire league.</p>

        <p>“If (Fields) doesn’t have a lot of turnovers and he is getting the ball out quick, I feel like that will be considered a success no matter what the team’s record is or the stats because they’re just not very good around him,” Tucker told me after his rankings came out.</p>

        <p>“You can make a strong argument that they have the worst receiving corps and the worst offensive line in the NFL. It’s almost ... unconscionable that a first-round quarterback would be going into his second year and you could say that is what he is being surrounded by.”</p>

        <p>Turnovers were an issue for the Bears. Fields’ interception rate of 3.5% was 32nd out of 33 quarterbacks with a minimum of 200 attempts. Only the Cowboys’ Dak Prescott, who objectively had a very rough second half of the season, had a higher rate at 3.9%.</p>

        <p>Fields led the NFL with 16 fumbles and remarkably lost only two. He has 28 fumbles in 27 career games with seven lost, so ball security no doubt will be an offseason focus.</p>

        <p>The upshot? The Bears have a ton of work to do in improving the offensive line and adding targets for the quarterback. It’s probably a good idea to wait and see what predictions Tucker has in midsummer. Maybe he will have the Super Bowl LVIII winner — or at least a better review of the Bears offensive line.</p>

The great thing about the ‘No Name Football Podcast’ with Olin Kreutz, Jason McKie and James ‘Big Cat’ Williams, besides the anecdotes they share about their playing days, is you get an unvarnished take on the current state of the team from guys who went through all sorts of ups and downs in their careers.</h2>

        <p>Last week’s episode was an entertaining listen with McKie, a former fullback, calling Justin Fields the “cologne” for Halas Hall.</p>

        <p>“You get beat down by Detroit but spray a little Fields and it’s all better,” McKie said. “In years past, they would have been berated, shredded, especially with the way the media is here in Chicago. It’s the Fields cologne. It’s that quarterback that gives you optimism that if you put pieces around him and he can develop, they can be something.”</p>

        <p>The three former players dispute the idea that the Bears have established a culture this season, and I agree. You can’t wave the culture banner coming off a three-win season. That doesn’t work, especially when there will be another heavy roster churn in 2023 and likely again in 2024. If you want to credit the players for their effort throughout a long season, that’s fair.</p>

        <p>[ [Don’t miss] Column: ‘Best available’ would require Chicago Bears to consider QBs in the draft. It’s an unlikely outcome — but a necessary process. ]</p>

        <p>“Imagine being a guy that is playing this week and they’re putting everyone else on IR,” Kreutz said on the podcast. “When we talk about learning how to win, building a culture, they’re demolishing it right now. There is no culture at Halas Hall right now. None. Zero. They’re going to have to start from ground zero again.</p>

        <p>“I tell the story of 2005, we went up to play the Vikings to end the year, but where we were situated in the playoffs we were already done and Lovie (Smith) told me he was going to sit me. I said no. As long as everybody is on the field, I’m going to be on the field. I have to play. I’m no more important.</p>

        <p>“Listen, I’m not Justin Fields. I’m not the starting quarterback. That’s a little different. But he’s not the only one (not playing). It’s interesting. Their young guys, their young leaders, Teven Jenkins, Justin Fields, the guys you are kind of looking to, they’ve never finished 17 games. This is a total rebuild we’re watching here. It’s piqued my interest.</p>

        <p>“It’s one of the most interesting things I’ve ever watched in the NFL. I was saying this the other day, what is this, ‘It’s all right to lose’? Like don’t worry about it, we’re building for next year. I told them, ‘Remember when it all started where everyone got a trophy? Everyone won the game?’ I know we’re losing nine in a row but did you see the 60-yard run by (Fields)? What did someone say the other day? ‘It’s been fun to watch.’ All that being said, now the hard part starts.”</p>

        <p>The possibility that Fields is the centerpiece required to turn things around has made the Bears a must-view even as the team struggled to the finish line.</p>

        <p>“I’m not saying it’s wrong, all I’m saying from an old, calloused ballplayer, it’s interesting,” Kreutz said. “They got this brand-new perfume, Justin Fields, they spray it. They spray it all over the place. The press conferences are like kumbaya.</p>

        <p>“As an old ballplayer, you’re taught every game matters. You’re building a culture. Winning matters. Obviously, you see the other side. We’re older now. You see they’re building a team. You see it from the organizational perspective. Things are falling into place. The plan — the evil plan — it is sort of falling into place. That is what is weirding me out.</p>

        <p>“But 2008 Chris Williams, 2011 Gabe Carimi, 2012 Shea McCllelin, 2013 Kyle Long, 2014 Kyle Fuller, 2015 Kevin White, 2016 Leonard Floyd, 2017 Mitch Trubisky, 2018 Roquan Smith, 2021 Justin Fields. There are not a lot of cornerstones in that building. (Ryan) Poles and them are going to have to do something that hasn’t been done in a while.</p>

        <p>“I will say this: I am interested. I didn’t think I would be. I’m an old-school football guy. I understand what people are saying. They were weirdly fun.”</p>

        <h2>8. One way to take some hits off Justin Fields next season would be to start throwing to the running backs more.</h2>

        <p>That’s something the offense didn’t do enough of as David Montgomery finished with a team-high 34 receptions out of the backfield. Montgomery had six games with two targets or fewer, excluding the Week 3 win over the Texans in which he exited with a knee injury. That’s not enough. Khalil Herbert finished with nine catches, and the team’s running backs had a total of 46.</p>

        <p>The Bears, who entered Week 18 ranked 21st in the NFL in target percentage for running backs at 17.5%, were pretty efficient when they did throw to backs. They had only 61 targets for running backs, so a 73.8% completion percentage is a positive.</p>

        <p>Montgomery isn’t a dynamic receiver. No one will mistake him for Austin Ekeler or Christian McCaffrey but he’s solid. He caught 42 passes a season ago, when he missed two games, and had 54 receptions in 2020. Pass catching is a deficiency for Herbert, but he still caught nine of 12 targets for 57 yards. Since 2006, the only season the Bears’ leading receiver out of the backfield had fewer than 34 catches was 2016 (Jordan Howard with 29).</p>

        <p>One explanation for the backs not catching more passes is the Bears probably leaned on max protection a little more than they would have preferred, keeping a back in to support pass blocking. Another is that Fields didn’t get to his check-down targets quickly enough, resulting in hits in the pocket or on a scramble. If the primary read is covered, get it to the back and check down for 6 yards, then move to the next play. That saves the quarterback from having to run and being exposed to defenders.</p>

        <p>Offensive coordinator Luke Getsy was part of an offense in Green Bay that featured running back Aaron Jones as a pass catcher at times. Who knows what shape the backfield takes in 2023 with Montgomery headed to free agency. But the Bears can take some hits off Fields by using the backs more in the passing game.</p>

        <h2>9. The Bears got Equanimeous St. Brown under contract for next season.</h2>

        <p>They signed him to a one-year, $1.25 million deal Wednesday, bringing the wide receiver back as a complementary piece. That’s a slight raise from the $965,000 St. Brown made in 2022, and with him agreeing to a deal before the season ended, it’s fair to assume a portion of the contract is guaranteed.</p>

        <p>St. Brown finished the season with 21 receptions for 323 yards and one touchdown. He had a season-high four receptions in the Oct. 24 victory at New England and 85 yards in the Dec. 4 loss to the Packers. Those numbers were fourth on the team in receptions and third in yardage.</p>

        <p>St. Brown isn’t the only player coming out of contract whom the Bears made a run at re-signing. I am told fullback Khari Blasingame was a candidate for a potential deal, the parameters of which are not known. The guess would be another modest one-year deal.</p>

        <p>Blasingame, who turns 27 on July 1, may want to see what else could be out there. A player eliminates 31 potential offers when he re-signs with a team just before the end of the season. Blasingame has played a minor role in the offense, but he has been durable, missing only one game with an illness, while averaging a little more than 10 offensive snaps per game with a consistent role on special teams.</p>

        <p>“I don’t have any comment on that right now,” Blasingame said of negotiations. “I’m just kind of soaking in the last time playing with this exact group of guys.”</p>

        <h2>10. The Bears have 30 players who will be free agents.</h2>

        <p>Twenty-three will be unrestricted free agents, a list headed by running back David Montgomery. Center Sam Mustipher, running back Darrynton Evans, defensive tackle Andrew Brown and linebacker Javin White will be restricted free agents. Cornerback Josh Blackwell, guard/center Dieter Eiselen and defensive end Andre Anthony will be exclusive rights free agents.</p>

        <p>The UFAs by position (those who started at least eight games in bold):</p>

        <p>QB: Nathan Peterman and Tim Boyle</p>
        <p>RB: David Montgomery</p>
        <p>FB: Khari Blasingame</p>
        <p>WR: Byron Pringle, N’Keal Harry and Dante Pettis</p>
        <p>TE: Trevon Wesco and Ryan Griffin</p>
        <p>OL: Riley Reiff, Michael Schofield and Dakota Dozier</p>
        <p>DT: Armon Watts, Angelo Blackson and Mike Pennel</p>

        <p>ST: LS Patrick Scales</p>
        <p>10a. The Bears had 33 players spend time on the practice squad this season. They had 34 in 2021 and 33 in 2020, two seasons that included many moves because of COVID-19. The NFL voted to expand the developmental squad to 12 players in 2020, then bumped that number to 16 the last two years to make it easier for teams to navigate the pandemic. It was decided the league would stay at 16 this season.</p>

        <p>Thirteen players who spent time on the practice squad appeared in a game: tight ends Chase Allen and Jake Tonges, offensive lineman Dieter Eiselen, quarterback Nathan Peterman, running back Darrynton Evans, linebackers Joe Thomas and DeMarquis Gates, kicker Michael Badgley, defensive lineman Gerri Green and defensive backs Harrison Hand, A.J. Thomas, Adrian Colbert and Greg Stroman. Twenty-one practice-squad players saw game action in 2021 and only 10 saw the field in 2020.</p>

        <p>Here’s a little nugget: The NFL originally formed practice squads in 1990 at the urging of New Orleans Saints GM Jim Finks, who was head of the league’s competition committee. Finks, of course, was an architect of the Bears’ Super Bowl XX team.</p>

        <p>Total number of Bears practice-squad players the last eight seasons:</p>

        <p>2022: 33</p>
        <p>2021: 34</p>
        <p>2020: 33</p>
        <p>2019: 20</p>
        <p>2018: 13</p>
        <p>2017: 27</p>
        <p>2016: 30</p>
        <p>2015: 30</p>
        <p>Look for a good handful of practice-squad players to sign reserve/future contracts in the coming days.</p>

        <p>10b. The Bears allowed opponents to convert 49% of third downs. Since 1996, there have been three worse figures: 2021 Chargers (49.5%), 2020 Panthers (49.2%), 2011 Chargers (49.2%). That’s a reason to consider drafting a front-seven player with the No. 1 pick.</p>

        <p>10c. Sunday’s results finalized the Bears’ list of 2023 opponents. Bears fans have a strong presence on the road, and there are some great trips next season.</p>

        <p>Besides the usual home/away dates with NFC North rivals, the Bears will host the Falcons, Panthers, Denver Broncos, Raiders and Cardinals. They will play road games against the Chiefs, Chargers, Saints, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Browns and Washington Commanders.</p>

        <p>10d. General manager Ryan Poles and coach Matt Eberflus are scheduled to meet with the media at 10:30 a.m. Tuesday.</p>

        <p>10e. It’s draft (and free agency) season now. Buckle up.</p>
