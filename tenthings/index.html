        <h1>Justin Fields’ Week 5 performance is no breakthrough — but it’s clear evidence of improvement. Brad Biggs’ 10 thoughts on the Chicago Bears loss.</h1>
        <p>Oct 10, 2022 at 6:26 am</p>

        <p>MINNEAPOLIS — 10 thoughts after the Chicago Bears fell in a big hole quickly while watching Kirk Cousins pick them apart underneath, only to battle back, take the lead and eventually lose to the Minnesota Vikings 29-22 Sunday afternoon at U.S. Bank Stadium.</p>

        <p>1. It was looking like the kind of game that you would wonder afterward how many years it will require for the Bears to ‘take the North,’ as general manager Ryan Poles declared back in January.</p>

        <p>Kirk Cousins set a Vikings franchise record by completing his first 17 passes, and Vikings wide receiver Justin Jefferson had a career-high 12 receptions. Those numbers partially explained how the Vikings converted 12 of 15 third downs (80%), the highest percentage an opponent has converted against the Bears since 1940, according to Pro Football Reference. The Vikings found a way to shut down the Bears ground attack and they possessed the ball for 13 minutes, 28 seconds more than the Bears.</p>

        <p>All of this normally would be a recipe for a disaster, the kind of blowout that becomes a footnote in the history between NFC North rivals, but the Bears managed to turn this into a game after falling behind 21-3. With a short week before the Washington Commanders visit Soldier Field on Thursday, they can briefly address areas of concern — there are more than enough — highlight some of the positives and move forward. There’s no time for anything else.</p>

        <p>The positives begin with quarterback Justin Fields. This wasn’t a breakthrough game, but it was the kind of game that validates what offensive coordinator Luke Getsy said last week when he hammered the point that Fields is getting better. The numbers, of course, said otherwise, but Getsy was unwavering in his support, and Fields held up at the noisy road venue while having to work with a silent count and the spotty talent he has been given at wide receiver.</p>

        <p>Fields finished 15 of 21 for 208 yards with one touchdown on a short toss to rookie Velus Jones Jr., who motored 9 yards to the end zone. Fields played a turnover-free game and ran the ball eight times for a team-high 47 yards.</p>

        <p>The 208 passing yards is Fields’ fifth-highest career total, but what stood out was the poise he operated with, the biggest reason he completed 71.4% of his passes. That’s significant considering he was below 51% through four games. There weren’t any of the fireworks you expect to see from young star quarterbacks, but keep in mind where the Bears are coming from and realize if Fields is going to pan out, it’s a long process.</p>

        <p>This game didn’t validate Fields as the long-term answer for the Bears, but Getsy said Fields has been “growing tremendously” and this was the first time you could look at the performance and not feel like someone was pulling your leg — like former Bears offensive coordinator Terry Shea was when he gave himself a B grade for directing one of the worst offenses in the league.</p>

        <p>“The important thing is that we stay focused, keep our eyes on that progress or on that process and we make sure we get better each and every week, and I believe that we’re in that phase,” Getsy said last week, a reminder that the team is on a journey and not a weekend adventure with the second-year quarterback.</p>

        <p>The defense couldn’t have played any worse than it did at the start — more on that in a little bit — but once things settled down the Bears regained their composure. It started with a deep shot from Fields to Darnell Mooney for a 39-yard gain with 1:54 remaining in the second quarter. The Bears benefited from a shanked 15-yard punt by the Vikings’ Ryan Wright, and a Minnesota holding penalty was tacked on, giving the Bears great field position at the 50.</p>

        <p>Trailing 21-3, Getsy called for a shot play, and it was a terrific catch by Mooney, who was matched by nickel cornerback Chandon Sullivan in coverage. Three plays later, David Montgomery’s 9-yard touchdown run provided a little boost for the Bears going into halftime. When Fields led an eight-play, 67-yard drive to open the third quarter, ending on Jones’ first NFL touchdown, the Bears had a shot.</p>

        <p>“I think we took a step forward for sure,” Fields said. “Felt like the protection was better. We definitely handled their blitz better than last week, so I felt like we took a step forward in that.</p>

        <p>“Just overall proud of everybody and the way they fought. We were down 21-3. A lot of teams in this league would’ve laid down and stopped playing, but I’m proud of our guys and the way they fought.”</p>

        <p>Next Fields led two field-goal drives, converting a fourth-and-4 with a 7-yard run. The Bears led 22-21 with 9:26 remaining before the Vikings went on a marathon 17-play, 75-yard drive that wiped seven minutes off the clock and included five third-down conversions.</p>

        <p>A shot to tie the game — or even win it with a two-point conversion — ended when wide receiver Ihmir Smith-Marsette was stripped from behind by Vikings cornerback Cameron Dantzler. But Fields was poised. The moment didn’t appear too big for him. He immediately responded from an 11-yard sack by slipping a quick pass to Montgomery and watching him weave 21 yards for a first down.</p>

        <p>There wasn’t panic, and these are moments we’ve seen the Bears offense implode in recent years.</p>

        <p>“Just his usual confidence,” said tight end Cole Kmet, who caught four passes for 45 yards. “That’s never left him, so it’s always been there and that was cool to see. He was kind of taking control, and I think we all rallied around him in that second half to be able to move the ball.”</p>

        <p>[ [Don’t miss] Column: Chicago Bears have been nothing short of ugly on offense — despite what OC Luke Getsy says ]</p>

        <p>Fields was more purposeful in trying to get the ball to Mooney. While Mooney caught only two passes for 52 yards, the Bears benefited from a 20-yard pass interference call on cornerback Patrick Peterson in the first quarter, and shortly after that, Fields took a shot at Mooney in the end zone that was just off.</p>

        <p>It’s always better to measure progress in terms of victories — and bigger stat lines eventually will need to come — but this was better in nearly every respect for Fields, especially when the Bears were trailing by three scores after only 1½ quarters.</p>

        <p>2. Sticking with Justin Fields and small, incremental improvements …</p>

        <p>I thought he did a better job of making some of the short throws. Entering Week 5, Fields ranked sixth in average intended air yards per throw, according to the league’s NextGen Stats, at 9.3. That reflects his aggressive nature to seek the longer throws downfield. It also underscores the number of easy, shorter completions he has eschewed or not seen.</p>

        <p>The leaderboard for this metric isn’t a who’s who of the best passers in the league, although it does include one former MVP. The five quarterbacks ahead of Fields resemble one of those lists where you say, “Which one of these is unlike the rest?”</p>

        <p>Jameis Winston, Saints, 11.4 yards</p>
        <p>Marcus Mariota, Falcons, 10.7</p>
        <p>Mac Jones, Patriots, 10.0</p>
        <p>Mitch Trubisky, Steelers, 9.9</p>
        <p>Lamar Jackson, Ravens, 9.6</p>
        <p>It’s a relatively small sample size, but considering the Kansas City Chiefs’ Patrick Mahomes ranked 15th at 8.0 and the Buffalo Bills’ Josh Allen and Los Angeles Chargers’ Justin Herbert were tied for 24th at 6.9 entering the week, it’s obvious that bigger isn’t necessarily better in this category.</p>

        <p>“You might not always think about it, but it really requires a disciplined quarterback to take that 4- or 5-yard throw when it’s there,” one senior personnel man said. “That’s what it is. The maturity to say, ‘I’m going to take this short one here and if my guy can’t make a play, make a defender miss, we’re going to do more with the next play.’</p>

        <p>“Then there’s probably part of it where the guys at the top of this list, they might not get off that first or primary read as fast as they need to in order to get to No. 2 or No. 3 in the progression. But it’s a maturity thing to me.”</p>

        <p>I feel like I keep repeating myself that we’re dealing with a small sample size, but that’s what it is. Fields’ second throw Sunday was 4 yards to Cole Kmet. He found Kmet open over the middle for about a 10-yard throw on third-and-10 on the first possession of the third quarter. Kmet turned and got upfield to gain another 13 yards. That was a nearly impossible play for this offense the first four weeks — a third-and-10 situation — but the big target was in the middle of the field and Fields got him the ball. Later in the quarter, there was an 8-yard pass play to Kmet on third-and-12. It didn’t move the chains but it set up a fourth down that Fields got with his legs. Fields took what was there.</p>

        <p>[ [Don’t miss] Week 5 recap: Chicago Bears rally from 18 points down, but late TD gives the Minnesota Vikings a 29-22 win ]</p>

        <p>Absolutely, the Bears have to get Darnell Mooney involved for more explosive plays, but don’t minimize the significance of these plays when trying to chart growth. If Fields can do a better job of taking what is there and not always seeking a chunk play — or moving from his first read to a secondary read quicker — the Bears will be better positioned to sustain drives and his completion percentage, which even after this game is an unacceptable 55.7%, will benefit from an uptick.</p>

        <p>“We’ve got to take the completions when they’re there,” Luke Getsy said Thursday. “I think he passed up a couple cheap completions that get you into that second-and-3, second-and-4 (against the New York Giants), which makes the (red) zone a lot easier to go score. We’ve got to improve on upon that. We’ve got to go get those little cheap completions.”</p>

        <p>3. Since 1991, there have been 26 instances when an offense converted 80% or more of its third downs in a game, according to Pro Football Reference.</p>

        <p>Bears coach Matt Eberflus greets Vikings quarterback Kirk Cousins after the Week 5 game at U.S Bank Stadium on Oct. 9, 2022.</p>

        <p>Those teams are 23-3 in those instances, with the Vikings the most recent example. You may remember the Buffalo Bills converted 9 of 10 third downs in their season-opening demolition of the Los Angeles Rams. More times than not, the team that dominated on third down won in blowout fashion, so the Bears can feel a little bit better about that.</p>

        <p>But a defense that needed a stop in the fourth quarter couldn’t come up with one: The Vikings went 5-for-5 on third down in a 17-play drive. And a defense that needed a stop early in the game to stem a huge surge by the Vikings couldn’t get one as Minnesota converted its first five third downs, scoring on three consecutive possessions to go ahead 21-3.</p>

        <p>Here are the first five third downs with yards needed:</p>

        <p>3: 6-yard pass to K.J. Osborn</p>
        <p>2: 7-yard pass to Adam Thielen</p>
        <p>2: 31-yard pass to Justin Jefferson</p>
        <p>10: 23-yard pass to Dalvin Cook</p>
        <p>1: 1-yard TD pass to Jalen Raegor</p>
        <p>And the final five third downs:</p>

        <p>1: Alexander Mattison 2-yard run</p>
        <p>3: 13-yard pass to Irv Smith</p>
        <p>5: Kirk Cousins 5-yard scramble</p>
        <p>8: 11-yard pass to Mattison</p>
        <p>1: Cousins 1-yard TD run on a sneak</p>
        <p>The sneak by Cousins plus a 2-point conversion put Minnesota ahead 29-22 with 2:26 remaining, and the Bears had used two timeouts. The common theme is obvious. The Vikings did a nice job staying out of third-and-long situations, and Cousins got the ball out quickly. It irked Bears coach Matt Eberflus enough that he came to his postgame news conference armed with numbers, rattling off the precise distances needed on Minnesota’s go-ahead drive.</p>

        <p>“We just have to finish and give ourselves a chance right there,” he said. “To me that would be the defense getting a stop on one of those third downs in that drive.”</p>

        <p>[ [Don’t miss] After 2 years of loss on and off the field, Eddie Jackson is playing with a rejuvenated spirit for the Chicago Bears — and the same bold confidence ]</p>

        <p>The Bears were a little better against the run — maybe — as Dalvin Cook ran for 94 yards on 18 attempts. The Vikings came out slinging it and kept slinging it, and before the Bears could adjust they had a big deficit. There has to be growing concern because opponents have converted 50.7% of third downs on the season. That’s an alarming total, especially when you consider the idea of complementary football with an offense experiencing clear growing pains. It’s no wonder Eberflus gave special teams coordinator Richard Hightower the green light for a surprise onside kick in the third quarter. More on that in a little bit.</p>

        <p>4. It’s fair to say the Bears will have a different strategy for Justin Jefferson when the teams meet in Week 18 at Soldier Field.</p>

        <p>Bears cornerback Kindle Vildor and safety Eddie Jackson can’t stop Vikings wide receiver Justin Jefferson during the second quarter at U.S Bank Stadium on Oct. 9, 2022.</p>

        <p>The Bears adjusted but not quick enough as Jefferson had seven receptions for 91 yards at the end of the first quarter. It was easy pitch-and-catch for Kirk Cousins, and they’re simply too good to allow that to happen.</p>

        <p>Jefferson finished with 12 catches for 154 yards, and the one thing Matt Eberflus and defensive coordinator Alan Williams accomplished was preventing the wide receiver from hitting a home run over the top of the defense. But, man, was he open way too often.</p>

        <p>Missing top cornerback Jaylon Johnson makes it more difficult, but it’s not an excuse. The good news is Johnson got in a little work at practice last week, signaling he might be ready to return Thursday after missing three games with a quadriceps injury. The rest of the secondary can’t let easy throws happen.</p>

        <p>“Justin was able to attack some one-on-one coverage early on,” Vikings coach Kevin O’Connell said. “Then they kind of settled into a little bit different philosophy defensively.”</p>

        <p>[ [Sign up now] Be the first to read Brad Biggs' 10 thoughts on the Chicago Bears ]</p>

        <p>Said Cousins: “When you’re just dropping back and going where your reads take you, but they’re giving you No. 1 open and players are separating and the run game is giving you favorable opportunities to throw the ball, it just kind of all converged on putting me in a position to be successful. I don’t think I was ripping it into brutally tight windows or having to throw and kind of be this hero. When you do that, it’s because everything around you is giving you this opportunity then to be successful.”</p>

        <p>Eberflus said the Vikings did a good job of moving Jefferson around with pre-snap motion early in the game, which made it difficult to roll coverage to help against the wide receiver.</p>

        <p>“But you have to do a better job there when that does happen to do some different things even when he is on the move,” Eberflus said. “We’ve just got to do a better job.”</p>

        <p>It looked like the Vikings were intent on going after rookie Jaylon Jones, who was on the field in the nickel package with Johnson sidelined. He was credited with a game-high 11 tackles (eight solo) because Cousins kept going at him time and again. Jones was called for defensive holding on Jefferson on a fourth-and-4 play in the fourth quarter. Kindle Vildor came up with an interception on the next play, but Jones was a marked man from start to finish.</p>

        <p>“Ever since I have gotten this opportunity in the Texans game, I expected it,” Jones said. “Today was the real test. Credit to them. They’re a good team and this comes with it. I am going to learn from it, watch the film and we have a short week so I’ve got to bounce back.”</p>

        <p>It was interesting talking to Jones afterward as he was almost doing self-corrections before getting to the tape. Understanding where he needs to get better should make the improvements easier, but it has to be cleaned up and blaming an undrafted rookie for Cousins’ hot start or Jefferson’s big day would be missing the mark.</p>

        <p>“There’s going to be so much stuff in the film, just certain coverages,” Jones said. “I know for a fact the little stop route Jefferson had in the red zone, I could have pressed that knowing the coverage we were in. There was a time I could have set a better edge. I kind of lost my gap. Just small things. I could feel it — if a play happened, I knew what I did wrong instantly.”</p>

        <p>The Vikings didn’t do anything complex. It was a lot of play action against Cover-3 that holds the curl defender. The cornerback is off and over the top, and Jefferson is going to run a comeback and beat the defense every time because the curl defender isn’t there.</p>

        <p>The Vikings beat Cover-2 as well. They would pull the flat or curl defender downhill, and that created large windows for Cousins. It was a basic game plan and they executed. Plus, Jefferson can push even the best cornerbacks upfield, and that leaves him room to come back downhill. That’s a tough matchup for anyone, especially Jones.</p>

        <p>5. The Bears will be without left guard Cody Whitehair for at least three more weeks after they placed him on injured reserve.</p>

        <p>Bears center Cody Whitehair (65) takes the field before a preseason game on Aug. 13, 2022, at Soldier Field. </p>

        <p>Whitehair left the Oct. 2 game against the Giants at MetLife Stadium with a right knee injury. A source said he is dealing with an MCL sprain, and the good news is the timetable for a return is expected to be about four weeks, meaning it’s possible he’ll spend the minimum time on IR. That gives the Bears four games — or maybe one or two more if Whitehair doesn’t return in the minimum time — to evaluate their linemen and determine what their best five will look like when Whitehair returns.</p>

        <p>It’s only the second time Whitehair, 30, has missed games in his career. He was sidelined for two games in 2020 with a calf injury. His next start will be the 100th of his career. It’s an important season for Whitehair from the standpoint that a new regime is in place and this is the final year he has guaranteed money in the contract extension he signed in September 2019. Whitehair is under contract for 2023 at $9.8 million plus a $100,000 workout bonus. He’s due a total of $10.25 million in 2024, the final year of the contract.</p>

        <p>“Cody is real tough now, starting all those games,” offensive line coach Chris Morgan said. “He’s your captain. The leadership, the toughness, the production, he (brings) all of that.”</p>

        <p>The offensive line against the Vikings was the same as it was for the conclusion of the Giants game: rookie Braxton Jones at left tackle, Lucas Patrick at left guard, Sam Mustipher at center, Teven Jenkins at right guard and Larry Borom at right tackle. The group was better this week, no doubt about that.</p>

        <p>[ [Don’t miss] Will wide receiver N’Keal Harry give the Chicago Bears offense a boost? ‘We’ll see how he picks it up.’ ]</p>

        <p>“It was cleaner,” Matt Eberflus said of the pocket. “(Justin Fields) had time to deliver. He can see down the field without being in a rush and ride the pocket like we talked about last week, so that’s definitely an encouraging thing to see. I think he had two sacks. Yeah, that’s an encouragement to keep that thing clean.”</p>

        <p>Said Borom: “I can’t really judge it until I get on the plane and watch the film. But it felt like as the game got going, we got stronger and progressed. It was 100% better than last week. As time goes on we’re only going to get stronger. We’ve just got to start fast and start hot and then we have a chance to be dominant.”</p>

        <p>I don’t know that this line will become dominant this season, but it wasn’t as bad as some made it out to be through three games and it was better in Minnesota than it was in New York. There’s a ton of focus on Fields, but young linemen are being evaluated for their future roles. When Whitehair returns around midseason, we’ll see what the coaches say about the lineup at that time.</p>

        <p>6. Let’s get to special teams, which has been a pretty good unit for the Bears.</p>

        <p>Bears kicker Cairo Santos with a successful field goal against the Vikings at U.S Bank Stadium on Oct. 9, 2022.</p>

        <p>A lot of coaches look to the comprehensive ranking system Football Outsiders uses, and it was notable that the Bears were No. 8 going into Week 5, jumping 14 spots after the performance against the Giants the previous week. Yes, that includes Velus Jones Jr.’s muffed punt in that game. It’s a small sample size but a good sign for new coordinator Richard Hightower.</p>

        <p>It’s evident Matt Eberflus is putting faith in Hightower as the Bears dialed up an onside kick in the third quarter. Linebacker Matt Adams, who left the game with a calf injury and had a walking boot on his left foot afterward, nearly came up with the recovery.</p>

        <p>Players I spoke to said they saw a little something on film during the week that tipped them off, and they were told the onside kick would be a possibility. What you see on tape is Vikings linebacker Brian Asamoah, on the front line, peeling out early to go back and set up for a return. That created a little void. Cairo Santos made a good kick and the Bears nearly got it.</p>

        <p>“That aggressive mentality is what we want to be about,” safety DeAndre Houston-Carson said. “We want to be the best in the league.”</p>

        <p>The risk was setting up Minnesota with premium field position, which the Vikings had after Akayleb Evans recovered at the Bears 48-yard line. But special teams delivered next as rookie defensive end Dominique Robinson blocked Greg Joseph’s 51-yard field-goal attempt. The Bears took over at their 41, nearly the same place they would have been with an onside kick recovery.</p>

        <p>“We worked on something all week and we went out there and executed — got through the hole,” Robinson said. “It was really just good penetration from us. We knew that they were weak — that side was weak — so we attacked them.”</p>

        <p>The last surprise onside kick that worked for the Bears was against the Vikings seven seasons ago at TCF Bank Stadium on the University of Minnesota campus. Coach John Fox gave the thumbs up for an onside kick to open the second half. Sherrick McManis recovered Robbie Gould’s kick.</p>

        <p>We’ll see where the Bears rank in Football Outsiders this week.</p>

        <p>7. Rough game for Ihmir Smith-Marsette, the former Vikings wide receiver, and hopefully a lesson learned.</p>

        <p>He had the ball ripped out of his clutch by Vikings cornerback Cameron Dantzler with a little more than a minute to play, ending the Bears’ comeback bid.</p>

        <p>Smith-Marsette caught a 10-yard pass and was able to stiff-arm the 6-foot-2, 190-pound Dantzler to slip by him. At that point he should have gotten out of bounds. It would have been roughly a 15-yard gain and the Bears would have been at about the Minnesota 40-yard line. Instead he tried for more.</p>

        <p>“I lost track of him after (the stiff-arm),” Smith-Marsette said. “When I turned to go back out of bounds, he just came from behind. He just took it away.</p>

        <p>“It’s tough. In those situations you just have to be smart as a player. I made him miss in the beginning and I should have just (gone) out of bounds. But knowing when you have a chance to potentially tie the game or even win it if we go for two, it’s tough when you are the one that let the team down.”</p>

        <p>“He stiff-armed me,” Dantzler said. “Kind of like an Odell (Beckham Jr.) stiff-arm and spin move. In my head, when he did that, I’m like, ‘Don’t let him get out of bounds.’”</p>

        <p>Smith-Marsette ran a nice curl route and the ball was delivered on time. But Smith-Marsette tried to make a move on safety Harrison Smith after he initially eluded Dantzler. It was poor ball security. If he got out of bounds, there would have been nearly 65 seconds left. He has to know Dantzler was in pursuit. Smith was about to cut him off and linebacker Brian Asamoah was running inside-out. That’s where all of the defensive pursuit came from — the inside — and Smith-Marsette has to know never to go back into pursuit, especially in the two-minute offense. He has to understand what the clock is telling him to do.</p>

        <p>Earlier in the fourth quarter, a 52-yard touchdown scramble by Fields was called back when Smith-Marsette was called for an illegal block in the back on Dantzler. It was at the point of attack — in plain view of officials. Illegal block?</p>

        <p>“He flopped,” Smith-Marsette said.</p>

        <p>I asked Dantzler if that was a fair evaluation of the play.</p>

        <p>“He was blocking me,” Dantzler said. “And I sold it pretty good. I was in a tough spot.”</p>

        <p>8. A couple of Vikings defenders had some interesting things to say about the Bears after the game.</p>

        <p>Veteran linebacker Eric Kendricks said the tone of the game shifted after the deep ball from Justin Fields to Darnell Mooney in the second quarter, and he was impressed with the volume of stuff the Vikings had to prepare for.</p>

        <p>“If the pass options weren’t open they always had (Fields’) legs,” Kendricks said. “He’s a good athlete. They tried a lot of plans. It was all over the place really. It was hard to game plan because they had so much stuff.</p>

        <p>“I think it was the big play. (Mooney) made an incredible catch and then they scored. After that, we were trying to get in rhythm but they were giving us different looks and we were trying to adjust from there.”</p>

        <p>That’s a compliment for what offensive coordinator Luke Getsy did, and the Bears executed better than they have in previous weeks. It wasn’t great but improved.</p>

        <p>Defensive lineman Dalvin Tomlinson told me he thought the Bears offensive line was more aggressive than what he saw on tape while preparing for the game.</p>

        <p>“They have some pretty young guys and they played pretty well today,” Tomlinson said. “They switched up a little of the schematics of the way they were blocking the last couple weeks compared to this game. I felt like they were more aggressive up front, and last week it didn’t look like they came off the ball (well) and they didn’t jump set as much. This week they were jump setting a lot. As soon as the ball was snapped they were trying to get straight on you so you wouldn’t have power.</p>

        <p>“They’d been running the ball crazy. We wanted to stop the run and then keep Fields in the pocket and get hands in his face. He moves around really well.”</p>

        <p>9. A lot of chatter — none of it new — about the quality of the Thursday night games.</p>

        <p>It wasn’t a defensive gem as much as a thorough display of poor offense when the Indianapolis Colts toppled the Denver Broncos 12-9 in overtime last week. Most of the complaints were about how the short turnaround — playing Sunday and playing again four days later — leads to a bad product.</p>

        <p>That certainly can be an issue, but you know what leads to a bad product? Mediocre teams playing one another. The NFL is full of mediocrity this season. Fourteen teams entered Week 5 with a 2-2 record. The Philadelphia Eagles (5-0) are the only unbeaten team, and it’s unusual that there wasn’t a winless team entering Week 5.</p>

        <p>What does it all mean? I don’t know. Some teams will find their stride by the time the calendar turns to November. Health will have a lot to do with it. Maybe the Bears can play a cleaner game Thursday than the Colts and Broncos did last week.</p>

        <p>10. Matt Eberflus has an interesting schedule this week.</p>

        <p>A lot of teams hold only walk-throughs during the short weeks from Sunday games to Thursday games. The Bears will practice Wednesday.</p>

        <p>“You’ve got to be mindful of the guys, but you’ve got to get the plan in,” Eberflus said of preparation for the Commanders. “The guys are coming in at (1 p.m. Monday) and (we) have a walk-through. So have meetings, go over the plan and you really can’t talk much about this game (against the Vikings). Make your corrections, a handful of plays, but you’ve got to go on the next one. (Tuesday) is a longer day and we have a walk-through practice. (Wednesday) we have a short helmets practice with speed.”</p>

        <p>The Bears will have another walk-through early Thursday, and then it’s game time.</p>

        <p>10a. The Bears have had only 52 players on the roster since placing Cody Whitehair on injured reserve Wednesday. It’s possible they will activate wide receiver N’Keal Harry before Thursday’s game.</p>

        <p>10b. Rookie cornerback Kyler Gordon has improvements to make, but he did a better job of tackling in space — a point driven home by his 10 tackles (eight solo).</p>

        <p>“A big emphasis for us has been tackling,” Gordon said. “I did have a few missed tackles I wish I could take back. Just going to practice and really working on that and taking it through to the game.</p>

        <p>“In practice really, just taking the right angle, the right steps and coming in with the right tempo and knowing when to go from long stride to short stride and really getting all the way through (the ball carrier). After practice, hit the bag and come down on an angle. Taking every rep seriously like it is a tackle rep.”</p>

        <p>10c. Velus Jones Jr.’s 9-yard touchdown reception on a little toss from Justin Fields is a great example of how the Bears can get the rookie wide receiver involved. He came on a fly sweep and the play was blocked well on the front side by right tackle Larry Borom and tight end Cole Kmet. Jones was able to use his strength to power through. Look for the offense to find more ways to get him involved.</p>

        <p>10d. It’s worth noting the Bears put defensive tackle Armon Watts in the starting lineup ahead of Angelo Blackson, who had been starting.</p>

        <p>10e. The Commanders opened as one-point favorites over the Bears at Westgate SuperBook in Las Vegas for Thursday’s game at Soldier Field.</p>
