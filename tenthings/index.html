<h1>No ‘wow’ plays for QB Caleb Williams but a Week 1 win: Brad Biggs’ 10 thoughts on the Chicago Bears</h1>

<br><br> 
On a gorgeous, perfect Sunday afternoon for football at Soldier Field, an effort that was far from pretty wound up getting the job done for the Chicago Bears in a 24-17 victory over the Tennessee Titans to begin the season.
<br><br> 
The much-hyped debut of No. 1 draft pick Caleb Williams will be remembered more for a defensive surge in the second half, a big pick-me-up from special teams and mistakes the rookie quarterback avoided as the Bears rallied from a 17-point deficit to win their opener for the first time since 2020 in Detroit.
<br><br> 
The difference was that young Titans quarterback Will Levis, a second-round draft pick in 2023, made catastrophic mistakes in the second half. The Bears forced him into some of those miscues and then pounced, as the defense picked up an offense whose effort would not be good enough to beat many teams.
<br><br> 
Here are 10 thoughts after the opener.
<br><br> 
1. Most of Caleb Williams’ preseason highlights came on extended plays outside the pocket.
<br><br> 
Williams would create time and space and then flash his gifted arm talent to make big plays.
<br><br> 
“He’s had some wow throws, there have definitely been some of those,” an assistant general manager for another NFC team said after the preseason. “Watching it, you’re wondering if he’s going to be like almost all of these young quarterbacks. They want to see it before they throw it and he’s not going to trust it otherwise. It almost seemed what he wanted to do was go Aaron Rodgers, go off schedule and find the guy. Backyard football.”
<br><br> 
The “wow” throws weren’t there Sunday, and I’d bet that was an emphasis of the Titans coaching staff: Contain Williams in the pocket and make him play from there.
<br><br> 
The final statistics weren’t pretty. He completed 14 of 29 passes for 93 yards with a long completion of 13. The only positive that stood out — and it should not be brushed aside — was Williams did not commit a turnover. Kickoff returner Velus Jones Jr. was responsible for the team’s only giveaway; if the Bears had one on offense, it probably would have been a killer.
<br><br> 
Williams remained poised despite the slow start and didn’t appear to press, which often leads to forced mistakes. The Bears won despite totaling only 148 yards of offense, which typically leads to a loss.
<br><br> 
Since 2000, teams with less than 150 yards of offense are 20-148 (a .119 winning percentage), with the Bears having an inordinate number of games that fit in that category. They’re now 2-10 when failing to reach 150 yards in that span. The previous victory was a 23-13 win over the Minnesota Vikings on Dec. 3, 2006, a day Devin Hester scored on a punt return and Lovie Smith’s defense totaled five takeaways to back Rex Grossman, who was 6 of 19 passing for 34 yards with three interceptions.
<br><br> 
“He’s smart as a whip and knows the offense,” coach Matt Eberflus said of Williams. “And we’ve just got to keep playing well around him as he grows and reinvests and improves. He’s going to learn a lot these first three, four games in terms of the NFL looks and speed and all the things we have to do.”
<br><br> 
Keenan Allen dropped what looked like a touchdown on second-and-goal from the 6-yard line in the second quarter. Teams count on a veteran wide receiver to make a play in that situation, and the ball just went off his hands, leading the Bears to settle for a field goal after a 67-yard kickoff return by DeAndre Carter gave the offense premium field position at the Titans 34.
<br><br> 

The Bears had starting field position at the Tennessee 48, 34 and 31 and at their own 43 in their 10 possessions. Not to score an offensive touchdown has to be bothersome for coordinator Shane Waldron.
<br><br> 
Protection wasn’t always great, and it appeared the Bears had issues on the interior against standout defensive tackle Jeffery Simmons and rookie T’Vondre Sweat, who was a rock in the middle at 362 pounds. Williams tried to escape by going backward, and he’ll learn quickly that retreating in the NFL is usually a bad idea.
<br><br> 
“I would say offensive play — obviously, we didn’t perform how we wanted to,” Williams said. “We want to be the most efficient team out there, myself included. Didn’t perform the way I wanted to. I missed a few passes that I normally don’t miss. All these other things. I think there’s small things that always lead up to big things, make those moments and things like that a lot bigger, that make games a lot closer.
<br><br> 
“Just the small things, whether it’s a pass play that I had to D’Andre Swift in the flat that I missed a little bit in front of him, whether it’s missing (DJ Moore) a little bit on the end route on the backside, a little bit in front of him. All these small moments that happen throughout the game that felt like I was in the right place, the right time, and I would say I was seeing it well. Just missed and misfired and (not) placing the ball where I wanted to.”
<br><br> 
Chicago Bears quarterback Caleb Williams says ‘I will be better’ after defense, special teams carry him to debut win
<br><br> 
Williams fired too long for Carter, who was open behind the Tennessee secondary on third-and-4 from midfield in the second quarter. The second-reaction plays that led to big profits in the preseason, sometimes against the opponent’s reserves, didn’t materialize. The Titans found a way to have someone in his face or in close pursuit when he was outside the pocket, and while he took only two sacks, the Bears didn’t get those chunk plays needed to ignite a drive.
<br><br> 
“We made it hard for him with different things we do defensively,” Titans safety Quandre Diggs said. “He’s learning. I think today was a good learning experience for him. No matter if people say he played bad, he was able to get a win today. We had the momentum. If we would have gotten the ball (from Williams), that would have really flipped it.”
<br><br> 
Combined with a rushing attack that struggled to get going — the only carry by a running back that went for more than 6 yards was Swift’s 20-yard gain with less than four minutes to play when he hurdled Diggs — the Bears were stuck in the mud for four quarters.
<br><br> 
“We got stalled,” center Coleman Shelton said. “We never really got in a rhythm as an offense, and you can see we finally started getting in it toward the end of the game there on that drive (when the Bears went from their 11 to the Tennessee 43 before punting with 2:33 to play). So it was really trying to find a rhythm, find our groove and get going.
<br><br> 
“(Williams) was great at staying positive and keeping us going and realizing we were in the game the whole time.”
<br><br> 
The off-schedule plays will come. Williams’ skill will be on display and he’ll have to iron out some of the small timing issues that seemed to be just off in the passing game. Waldron needs to find a rhythm.
<br><br> 
“It’s just not being on the same page passing-wise,” Williams said. “And run game, we’ll be better. Obviously it’s great to get this first win. And we’re all excited, went into the locker room, celebrated. I sat down, enjoyed the moment.
<br><br> 
“And just watching the other guys, I understand that I need to be better. I will be better. And then just taking in the first one. It’s unbelievable.”
<br><br> 
2. Defensive end Darrell Taylor got off to a big start with the Bears.
<br><br> 
“Hard Knocks” captured GM Ryan Poles, after negotiations broke down with the New England Patriots early in training camp to trade for Matthew Judon, telling director of football administration Matthew Feinstein that if Judon “has 20 sacks or something, yeah, it’ll make me sick.”
<br><br> 
Imagine how Poles will feel if Taylor, whom the Bears acquired before roster cuts for a sixth-round draft pick, has 12 sacks.
<br><br> 
Taylor had two sacks and a career-high eight tackles Sunday, with his strip-sack of Will Levis in the fourth quarter setting up a 48-yard field goal by Cairo Santos.
<br><br> 
<br><br> 
It could be the Bears found just the right player with the right skill set to line up opposite Montez Sweat. Scouts say Taylor has speed and a good get-off and can be proficient hunting the quarterback, which is supported by his 21½ sacks for the Seattle Seahawks over the previous three seasons.
<br><br> 
He isn’t considered great against the run, but the Bears traded for him to boost their pass rush and if Sunday’s debut is a sign of things to come, they’re going to use him primarily on passing downs.
<br><br> 
The Bears had chipped into the Tennessee lead but the Titans were on their own 48-yard line on third-and-6 when Matt Eberflus blitzed with middle linebacker Tremaine Edmunds coming up the middle. Running back Tyjae Spears chopped down Edmunds, but Levis wasn’t able to climb the pocket and floated out to his right.
<br><br> 
Taylor used a jab step on Titans left tackle and first-round draft pick JC Latham and quickly swiped his hands. Then it was a foot race — what Taylor does best.
<br><br> 
“I just came off the edge and saw the ball was within my reach,” said Taylor, who knocked the ball out and weak-side linebacker T.J. Edwards recovered.
<br><br> 
What does that look like, especially in the fourth quarter of a one-score game?
<br><br> 
“Your eyes get big,” Taylor said as his eyes bulged out of his head. “It’s like seeing a million dollars, really. So my eyes got big and I knew it was an opportunity for us to cause a turnover and give the ball back to our offense.”
<br><br> 
Taylor is in a contract year and earning $3.136 million this season. He got the nod over rookie fifth-round pick Austin Booker and Daniel Hardy, who both played well in the preseason. The Bears opted to go with experience more often, and Booker had a tough time on the Tennessee drive that finished with a 26-yard touchdown run by Tony Pollard. The Titans were running right at Booker.

“Straight energy,” Eberflus said of Taylor. “He brings it every single day. I love his passion. He fits in right with our guys. I had a short meeting with him, told him about us and how we operate and he loved it. So it’s good that he’s here.”
<br><br> 
Said Taylor: “It definitely feels great — it’s my debut and I show my teammates what I am all about and show them what I am willing to do for this team.”
<br><br> 
When he met with reporters after the trade last month, Taylor’s head still was spinning in his new surroundings. He was processing being part of a business transaction. The team that drafted him had flipped him for a late Day 3 draft pick as the Seahawks deemed he wasn’t a great fit for what they’re transitioning to on defense.
<br><br> 
“It definitely hurts,” he said. “But that’s what the league is about. Trades happen every year. That’s why I am here and I’m here to make an impact on this defense and on this team. That is my only goal.”
<br><br> 
I pointed out the metaphor Taylor used when he described seeing Levis holding the ball as he turned the corner could apply to him at the end of the season as well. There’s a bag of money — with way more than a million dollars in it — if he has a big season.
<br><br> 
“It’s definitely sitting there,” Taylor said. “For sure.”
<br><br> 
And if Taylor can pursue that bag after the season — from the Bears or any other team — Poles will feel pretty damn good. Judon, by the way, had five tackles and a half-sack in his debut for the Atlanta Falcons, an 18-10 home loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers.
<br><br> 
3. Some shrewd adjustments on defense and strong play by the secondary swung this game for the Bears.

That and the scoop-and-score on the team’s first blocked punt in 12 years.
<br><br> 
The Titans controlled the game in the first half because they found success on the ground. Tony Pollard had nine carries for 64 yards at halftime and Tennessee had 16 rushes for 115 yards in the first half against the NFL’s No. 1 run defense in 2023.
<br><br> 
It looked like Matt Eberflus switched things up in the second half and went to a Wide 9 look with his defensive ends. The Titans were attacking them on the edges in the first half — that’s where Pollard’s long touchdown run came — and countering, and the Bears couldn’t contain the attack.
<br><br> 
So the Bears widened out their ends with a goal of funneling the action back inside, and Tennessee kept trying to go there with no success. The Titans had only 25 rushing yards in the second half on 11 carries. By widening out up front, the Bears created more one-on-one blocks and were able to win more of them.
<br><br> 
The idea of halftime adjustments is often overblown. Adjustments happen all the time on the sideline. There is a small army of coaches in a box, a sideline full of tablets with all the plays to review and coaches to make shifts or subtle changes on the go. The 12 minutes teams have at halftime is a chance for a quick breather, a bathroom break, some fluids and a few coaching points. That’s it.
<br><br> 
But from the look of things, the Bears adjusted Sunday and the Titans didn’t have a counter.
<br><br> 
Eberflus was also aggressive in going after Will Levis. It sure looked like the Bears were comfortable putting their cornerbacks in man-to-man situations on more than a few occasions. Levis overshot Calvin Ridley when Ridley had Tyrique Stevenson beat down the sideline.
<br><br> 
But the Bears held up, the rush got to Levis and the cornerbacks made huge plays at big moments, none bigger than Stevenson’s 43-yard interception return for a go-ahead touchdown with 7:35 remaining.
<br><br> 
Levis tried to flip the ball away for an incomplete pass as DeMarcus Walker was wrapping him up, one of four quarterback hits for Walker. It was the kind of terrible play that will be on Levis’ “highlight” reel for months if he continues to struggle.
<br><br> 
“I was thinking sack, let’s get off the field, good (stuff) there for the defense,” Stevenson said. “And then, in a split-second, he let it go. And then, I ain’t going to lie to you, next thing I know I am in the end zone doing my dance. Everything was just a blur.”
<br><br> 
Column: At the start of a new QB era, the Chicago Bears win their season opener with an old-school formula
<br><br> 
Levis didn’t factor in the game situation. The Titans were ahead 17-16 and it was third down on their 45-yard line. Take the sack and even with a modest punt, the Bears are starting inside their 30.
<br><br> 
“The way our defense was playing, it’s killer,” Titans coach Brian Callahan said. “It’s killer.”
<br><br> 
This underlies my point about Williams not making the kind of catastrophic mistakes young quarterbacks commit that simply doom their teams.
<br><br> 
“That thing is going to be on blooper reels for the rest of his career,” Stevenson said. “He lost the game based off him making a decision he didn’t have to make. Eat it, punt it and make our offense come back. Instead, he throws it to me.”
<br><br> 
Jaylon Johnson added a pick to seal the game when Levis, again under pressure (the Bears totaled 10 QB hits), lofted a pass off his back foot. As out of sorts as the Bears were on offense, they found the necessary adjustments to sync on defense and that propelled the rally.
<br><br> 
4. Daniel Hardy’s 40 special teams snaps in the preseason were probably just as important as his 3½ sacks in finding a spot on the 53-man roster.
<br><br> 

If you followed the clues the coaching staff left — Matt Eberflus and others talked about what great shape Hardy was in and how well he was moving — it was clear the best chance Hardy had to earn a job was proving he could help on special teams. When the Bears decided to go heavy at defensive end — they kept six on the 53-man roster (one or two more than most teams) — Hardy had a spot.
<br><br> 
He took a step toward securing that position with a blocked punt midway through the third quarter that safety Jonathan Owens scooped up and returned 21 yards for a touchdown. The Bears looked well on their way to defeat at the time. Little was going right and if the Titans played mostly mistake-free football (they did not), it would be a disappointing opener for the home crowd.
<br><br> 
<br><br> 
Hardy overpowered linebacker Jake Gibbens and was on top of punter Ryan Stonehouse for the Bears’ first blocked punt since a 2012 meeting with the Titans. It was a pressure that special teams coordinator Richard Hightower put on. His unit, with the exception of the massive gaffe by Velus Jones Jr., played very well and played hard.
<br><br> 
It appeared the Bears looped some players to the left on the block and got the guard to lean inside. Hardy had a clear path. Earlier in the game, the Bears tried confusing the Titans by rolling a cornerback on a punt.
<br><br> 
“It’s an amazing feeling to be able to accomplish something like that with your teammates, and I wanted to find Coach Hightower and let him know,” Hardy said. “As a special teams coordinator, you’ve got to put a lot of pressure on guys to be able to call something like that. You can run into the punter and the offense has a fresh set of downs. I wanted to let him know I had his back.
<br><br> 
“It is something we drew up. Something we had been working on all training camp. And you know, just a huge thank you to Coach Hightower for trusting us to get that done. We were feeling the momentum a little bit but we needed a spark on teams, we needed to help fuel the offense, defense, everything. Fantastic call trusting us to get the job done.”
<br><br> 
Hardy, who had 128 snaps on special teams for the Los Angeles Rams in 2022, knows that’s where he’ll have to make his biggest impact right now.
<br><br> 
“Making the 53 is more than just playing on offense and defense,” he said. “They gave me a job and I am doing the best I can with it. Just being grateful to be here. Not taking anything for granted. I am looking for ways to impact the game in a positive way.”
<br><br> 
5. With a chuckle and an affirming nod, Mark Sanchez looked at his Week 1 assignment when Fox unveiled its schedule for announcers to open the season.
<br><br> 

There isn’t another broadcaster at the network — maybe anywhere — who better understands the situation, pressure and expectations that will be and already have been thrust upon Caleb Williams.
<br><br> 
Once upon a time, Sanchez was the fifth pick in the 2009 draft by the New York Jets, the heir apparent to franchise icon Joe Namath. Sanchez, who was a backup for the Bears in 2017, doesn’t just have an idea of what Williams will encounter for another quarterback-starved franchise. He has walked a very similar path.
<br><br> 
Sanchez, a tanned and toned California boy, was the next coming of Broadway Joe at the beginning of his career, and the hype (and hope) only grew as the Jets reached the AFC championship game in his first two seasons.
<br><br> 
So if anyone can describe what Williams will experience in the beginning of his NFL journey, it’s Sanchez, who also starred at USC and got to know Williams during the last two seasons in Los Angeles.
<br><br> 
“It’s so funny,” Sanchez said Wednesday. “How much this plays into this broadcast. Not about me but more about the situation. I’ve got to go in there and replace Joe Namath and he’s got to go in there and be Sid Luckman and Jim McMahon. That’s a lot.
<br><br> 
“How many times have these fans had a preseason Hall of Famer in the last 20, 30 years? ‘Hey, this is the guy! This is the guy!’ Somehow they’re not there. It’s not always the player’s fault. Sometimes it’s the situation. Sometimes it’s the circumstances, but that’s stuff that you can’t really focus on but there is just a lot of noise to it.
<br><br> 
“And you win the first game out of the gate and it’s, ‘Yep, we got our guy.’ You lose the first game out of the gate and it’s, ‘Oh, man, here we go again.’ Navigating those seas is difficult for a young guy. That market is every bit as tough as New York because there is only one team. At least in New York if you’re playing well and the Giants stink or the other way around, they can kind of deflect some of the fire coming your way. It’s a white-hot spotlight and that’s not easy.”
<br><br> 
Column: No pressure, Caleb Williams. The Chicago Bears QB only has to lift an entire city on his shoulders.
<br><br> 
It’s so hot, the Bears’ last two first-round picks at the position before Williams — Justin Fields and Mitch Trubisky — each explained at different times why they had shelved their social media accounts when the noise and frustration of the fan base escalated. It’s a pressure cooker trying to be the answer for an organization that, through no fault of the current quarterback, has bungled the position time and time again, regime after regime.
<br><br> 
That’s precisely one of the pitfalls ahead of Williams, the kind of cavernous drop that can swallow a quarterback, all of his promise, all of his talent, and leave everyone to extend their arms and ask the same question: “Where did it go wrong?”
<br><br> 
“The default answer is try and block it out and focus on what’s important and win on Wednesday so you can win on Sunday, all those cliches that everybody is going to tell him,” Sanchez said. “But it is nearly impossible in today’s world to just completely tune that out. It’s impossible with the phones and all the social media stuff, and he’s a guy that is really the first superstar NIL player, the first of his kind. Not like LeBron James, who went high school to pro, but that kind of projection, you know what I mean?
<br><br> 
“And I don’t know what you say to him other than, ‘Yeah, you try to block it out but you’re inevitably going to see some of it and people are going to bring it up when you’re signing autographs, it’s going to come up in press conferences.’ They’re already telling him nobody has thrown for 4,000 yards or 30 touchdowns. This guy has got to go win games. Don’t worry about all of that. All of that stuff is going to take care of itself and a lot of that stuff is out of your hands.”
<br><br> 
Getting to know Williams as he has — Sanchez said he has tried to act as a sounding board and isn’t one to reach out unless he’s asked — the 37-year-old wonders if the Bears rookie is uniquely wired to thrive under the spotlight instead of melting. Sure, it’s a dangerous line to walk, but the only chance for success is for Williams to be true to himself — he is who he is.

“It’s going to be interesting to watch and he’s one of those guys that, in some ways, feeds off all of that stuff, which is part of his personality,” Sanchez said. “So telling him to lock it up and totally change his approach, I don’t think that is the right advice either because he’s more active on the social media platform and he has other interests outside of football. But you lose three games in a row and everyone is going to say, ‘Oh, man, that fashion show in Milan doesn’t sound so good.’ That’s the way it goes.
<br><br> 
“The GQ cover in New York (in September 2011), people gave me heat for that. ‘He spent all that time at the photo shoot.’ The photo shoot was five hours. But you throw an interception and it’s, ‘Well, you could have been studying your playbook.’ Is that totally fair? No. But the thing Caleb signed up for isn’t totally fair. It’s so funny he could be an absolute superstar there. There is buzz around him. They’re comparing him to Michael Jordan and I’m like, ‘Holy smokes!’ That’s a lot. How are you going to handle that?
<br><br> 
“Some of the advice I would give is bring the guys with you. Bring them to the movie premieres and Broadway shows and fashion shows and all of the stuff that you can do individually unless it’s something you are passionate about that is kind of your one thing. But bring them with you. When I got invited to Broadway shows, I wouldn’t go unless I had 10 tickets. I’d decline. Because when you go as a group it turns into a team bonding session instead of just, ‘Hey, this guy is out and about. He doesn’t focus. He’s got too many interests. He’s got too many irons in the fire.’ That turns down the heat a little and it gives him time to learn his guys.”

Sanchez pointed out the Hollywood narrative that Williams is cast in, at least in some spaces, and laughs.
<br><br> 
“He’s not even from Southern California,” Sanchez said. “He was there two seasons. I was. I was just this surfer dude, GQ, pretty boy from California, and that is a tough narrative in a tough East Coast city, New York, where you hear, ‘You ain’t ready for this.’
<br><br> 
“Then, when people got to meet me, got to know me, all right, maybe he is OK. You can’t fight that initial stigma. This guy (Williams) is from D.C.”
<br><br> 
Nor can Williams battle the storyline that he’s here to replace Luckman, McMahon, whoever and lead the Bears in ways they’ve only imagined, at least in the Super Bowl era. Maybe Sanchez is right. Maybe his understanding of the obstacles ahead of Williams and the way he’s wired is accurate. Just maybe Williams is ready for this.
<br><br> 
Sunday’s debut wasn’t pretty, but Williams was measured afterward. He knows he has to be better.

6. The Bears already have given up on Velus Jones Jr. as a punt returner.
<br><br> 

Last month they effectively gave up on him as a wide receiver in a crowded position room and switched him to running back. And if he cannot return kickoffs for them, well, he’s running out of ways to make himself useful.
<br><br> 
Jones found a solid role as a kickoff returner last season. He averaged 27.4 yards per return on 16 attempts, and there was a feeling the NFL rule changes on kickoffs would make him a potentially bigger weapon.
<br><br> 
So when Jones muffed the first kickoff return of the season — then inadvertently kicked the ball forward from the 3-yard line to the 23, where Tennessee’s Julius Chestnut recovered — it was “here we go again.”
<br><br> 
Jones’ mishaps on punt returns are well-documented. He had two killer muffs as a rookie in 2022 that directly led to losses to the New York Giants and Washington Commanders. He had a third fumble that season on offense against the Philadelphia Eagles and a dropped touchdown pass.
<br><br> 
The Bears yanked him from punt returns and he hasn’t been seen there again. They pulled him from kickoff returns after Sunday’s mishap, pairing DeAndre Carter, the new punt returner, with running back Khalil Herbert.
<br><br> 
“I just took my eyes off the ball,” Jones said. “I’ve caught that ball like a million times. So it’s like sometimes you can get lackadaisical. Then I didn’t realize when I looked for it, I actually kicked it. So that was just an unfortunate thing. Never happened to me before. It’s the small details. Just got to go back to square one, just looking everything in.”
<br><br> 
Jones’ momentum was going forward when the mistake happened. It was setting up to be perhaps the start of a big return because he would have been at full speed in an instant. And then the ball hit off his chest and — pfft! — was gone.
<br><br> 
“Facts, facts, facts,” Jones said. “It really sucks, but we got the win at the end of the day and I appreciate my teammates for having my back and, you know, that was where I am just trying to focus on the next play.”
<br><br> 

Does Jones fear this will number his days as a return man? He still got some spot play on offense — he had two carries for 11 yards and caught one pass for 8 yards — but the old saying is “the more you can do,” and you have to start wondering what the Bears have in mind for Jones if there’s actually less he can do.
<br><br> 
“It’s no concern,” he said when I asked about potentially being benched on kickoff returns. “Obviously I am a competitor. I know what I bring to the table, and like I said, that was unfortunate. I know the staff believes in me. They’ve seen me return how many kicks? Really, ain’t much to say about that. Definitely that can’t happen.”
<br><br> 
Matt Eberflus supported Jones after the game and that’s not surprising. Coaches rarely predict a player’s demise in a postgame setting. But as giddy as the Bears were to keep Jones on the 53-man roster in the final episode of “Hard Knocks,” their faith just had a big hole poked in the middle of it.
<br><br> 
“I was proud of Velus,” Eberflus said. “I really was. I know that wasn’t what he wanted, obviously. He did a nice job coming in at the halfback position, did a nice job getting north. I thought he did well. We’ll evaluate in terms of kick return as we go.”

7. DeeJay Dallas is the answer to the trivia question that will come up years from now.
<br><br> 

Who was the first player to return a kickoff for a touchdown after the NFL made massive changes to the special teams play in 2024?
<br><br> 
Dallas of the Arizona Cardinals hit the Buffalo Bills for a 96-yard touchdown Sunday, the only score on a kickoff through the first 15 games of the season. DeAndre Carter of the Bears had the second-longest return — 67 yards. There was one other return of more than 50 yards heading into the Monday night game between the New York Jets and San Francisco 49ers.
<br><br> 
What does the small sample size show us so far? There were returns on 34.6% of kickoffs, so the number has increased but maybe not to the level the league imagined. The competition committee’s newfangled approach to the kickoff was put in place to encourage more returns. The league has been crusading for ways to make the play safer for years with a goal of reducing head injuries, but an all-time low 21.8% of kickoffs were returned last season.
<br><br> 
Some teams didn’t fear the possibility of a big return. The Bears covered five kickoffs and had only one touchback for Cairo Santos. The New Orleans Saints covered nine returns in a blowout victory over the Carolina Panthers with only one touchback. The Panthers had a long return of 31 yards and averaged 25.8 yards on their nine attempts.
<br><br> 
The Kansas City Chiefs, New England Patriots, Atlanta Falcons, Indianapolis Colts, New York Giants and Los Angeles Rams booted nothing but touchbacks.
<br><br> 
The tally going into Monday night: 156 kickoffs, 54 returns, 100 touchbacks and two kicks out of bounds.
<br><br> 
Fifteen games is a small sample size — and the ball will fly in outdoor stadiums while the weather is warm — but the results were a dramatic departure from what we saw in the preseason, which is not surprising. There were returns on 70.5% of kickoffs in the preseason as teams wanted to see how the new rules worked and test various strategies.
<br><br> 
NFL owners approve a radical overhaul to kickoff rules, adopting setup used in XFL
<br><br> 
Then real games began Thursday in Kansas City, and the kickoff was back to being a play with rare action. There were 11 kickoffs between the Chiefs and Baltimore Ravens and nine touchbacks spotted at the 30-yard line. On Friday in Brazil, the Green Bay Packers and Philadelphia Eagles had 10 touchbacks on 13 kickoffs with the Packers’ Keisean Nixon taking out the final kickoff from 8 yards deep in the end zone with 27 seconds remaining, a desperation move for a big play.
<br><br> 
The Bears and Titans combined for three touchbacks and seven returns. The Titans’ Jha’Quan Jackson had five returns for 127 yards (25.4 average) with a long of 30.
<br><br> 
Will we see more touchbacks in Week 2? That depends on a lot of factors. Game situations. Perceived ability of the return man. Leg strength of the kicker. How much does the head coach want to risk?
<br><br> 
The original discussion in the spring was to have touchbacks spotted at the 35. Some I chatted with believed that would incentivize coaches to avoid kicking the ball into the end zone. In order to get the dramatic rule change passed, the touchback spot was shifted to the 30 and so far we’re not seeing as much change as some probably expected or hoped.
<br><br> 
One special teams coordinator I texted predicted this will be the status quo for the first few months until the weather is colder and the ball doesn’t travel as well off the tee.
<br><br> 
“It’s going to be touchbacks until we get a better feel for what the officials and the teams are going to do,” another coordinator said.
<br><br> 
For one week, anyway, the Bears didn’t show fear covering kickoffs, and cornerback Jaylon Jones tallied three special teams tackles.
<br><br> 
8. Titans running backs Tony Pollard and Tyjae Spears combined for seven receptions for 23 yards.
<br><br> 

That’s notable because the Bears allowed what you could call a lot of hidden yardage in this area a year ago.
<br><br> 
In 2023, the Bears allowed 1,003 receiving yards to running backs, far and away the most in the league. The Los Angeles Chargers were next at 772 and only three other teams allowed more than 700. Not only did the Bears allow the most yardage, but they also were 32nd in the league in yards per reception for opposing running backs at 9.4.
<br><br> 
This is getting into the weeds a little bit, but with 23.6% of opponents’ passing yardage going through running backs, it was worth exploring. Aaron Jones of the Green Bay Packers had receptions of 51 and 35 yards, the latter a touchdown, in last season’s opener. The Atlanta Falcons’ Tyler Allgeier scored on a 75-yard screen. Three other completions to running backs went for more than 30 yards.
<br><br> 
The Allgeier play was an outlier. Nickel cornerback Kyler Gordon blitzed from the side Allgeier released to, and the Falcons had it blocked well. Should the Bears have prevented a touchdown? Yes. But that was an example of the right call at the right time by Atlanta.
<br><br> 
The vast majority of the 107 passes completed to running backs last season were check-downs.
<br><br> 
“You’ve really got to look at it,” linebackers coach Dave Borgonzi said. “You came up with a few of those — Allgeier, Aaron Jones, (Austin) Ekeler had one against us in L.A. But if you look at it as a whole, when you play a lot of zone defense, when they check the ball down, those count as receiving yards for backs.
<br><br> 
“When you play zone defense and they throw check-downs, that’s the intent of the coverage. So you can pick out three or four plays and that’s fair. We could have done a better job with coverage, but if you look at the whole thing, it’s the check-downs where the backs get yards. But when they’re checking it down, that means the zone coverage is doing its job because they’re throwing it down as opposed to over your head.”
<br><br> 
Where the Bears likely are focused is preventing chunk plays to running backs. Because they play such a heavy percentage of Cover-2 and Cover-3, it’s the natural outlet for the quarterback when the secondary takes away the intermediate and deep routes.
<br><br> 
You won’t see a team mount a 70-yard touchdown drive by simply dumping it to a running back play after play. Eventually the offensive coordinator and quarterback will get bored and make a mistake or the defense will make a play. But the defense as a whole needs to do much better than allowing running backs to average nearly a first down on every reception.
<br><br> 
“As backers, that is always an emphasis for us,” said weak-side linebacker T.J. Edwards, who had 15 tackles and 10 solos Sunday. “Especially for how we play an attacking style. Screens and outside perimeter throws and runs are always going to be things that we face. So it’s definitely something you want to improve on.
<br><br> 
“Anything that has hurt you in the past, you know you will continue to see until that fire has been put out. We’re kind of ready for it all. As linebackers, we take that to heart. I feel like we’ve put an emphasis on it.”
<br><br> 
9. In a bid to find their best five offensive linemen, the Bears are rotating guards again.
<br><br> 

It’s something they did with Lucas Patrick and Teven Jenkins in 2022. On Sunday, Nate Davis started at right guard and newcomer Ryan Bates rotated in throughout the game. It was a planned move and the goal has to be to settle on a starting five and stick with it while hoping to avoid the injury bug that hit in the trenches a year ago.
<br><br> 
Davis missed the first half of training camp with a groin injury and Bates was out the second half of camp with a pre-existing shoulder issue. So the competition the team originally wanted — Bates battling Coleman Shelton to be the starting center — never got going. Once Davis returned, it looked like a three-man competition for two starting spots, but Bates quickly went out.
<br><br> 
Now the Bears have to sort through possibilities in the regular season.
<br><br> 
“It felt good,” Bates said. “I’ve only had one week of practice. I had to figure it out quick.”
<br><br> 
Bates had to figure it out against some pretty stout interior players and that didn’t make it easier. The hope moving forward is that he can manage the shoulder issue.
<br><br> 
“I’ve dealt with it before so I know how to handle it,” he said. “I know how to work around it.”
<br><br> 
Does he look at it as a job competition heading into Week 2?
<br><br> 
“Of course,” Bates said. “Every week, everyone is competing. That is the way the NFL works.”

10. Northern Illinois still was the talk of college football Sunday morning, fresh off a stunning upset of then-No. 5 Notre Dame.
<br><br> 

Coach Thomas Hammock was going through game tape in the solitude of his office less than 12 hours after arriving back on campus in DeKalb, having given his staff and players the day off (the Huskies have an open date in Week 3).
<br><br> 
“The crazy thing is when you’re watching the tape, you forget all of the little things that happened throughout the course of the game,” Hammock said. “Because your mindset during the game is the next play. There were some critical plays in that tape when you watch the full copy — offense, defense and special teams — that I had honestly forgotten about that happened.”
<br><br> 
What happened — a 16-14 victory, sealed when Cade Haberman blocked a 62-yard field-goal attempt as time expired Saturday in South Bend, Ind. — won’t be forgotten for a long time at NIU. Not the go-ahead field goal by Kanon Woodill with 32 seconds remaining. Not the huge day for running back Antario Brown. Not the two sacks by Devonte O’Malley. Not any part of it.
<br><br> 
It was the first victory by a Mid-American Conference school over an opponent ranked in the top five. It was the first time NIU had beaten an opponent in the top 10. The Huskies upset No. 15 Maryland in 2003, the highest-ranked opponent they’d beaten previously. That was 21 seasons ago.
<br><br> 
NIU entered the AP Top 25 on Sunday at No. 25, while Notre Dame tumbled to No. 18.
<br><br> 
“It changes the trajectory of your program,” said Hammock, who posted a photo on social media Sunday morning of former Huskies coach Joe Novak walking off the field after an upset of No. 21 Alabama during that same 2003 season. “I think it changes the trajectory of the school. We want to increase enrollment and get the excitement back on the NIU campus. In turn, that will help us as a football program.”
<br><br> 
<br><br> 
Hammock, 43, is in his sixth season at NIU after leaving a job as the Baltimore Ravens running backs coach to return to his alma mater. He was part of what Novak built, first as a player and then as a position coach.
<br><br> 
He has tried to systematically build the program, knowing it would be tough for NIU to be a major player in the transfer portal. He preaches family and development and hard work and had his players believing they could go to Notre Dame and succeed.
<br><br> 
“We’ve got a veteran team,” he said. “A lot of guys that have been here and a lot of seniors that have been through highs and lows.
<br><br> 
“We’re good in the trenches — the O-line and D-line. Those games normally come down to that aspect of the game, and we built our team inside-out. I was very confident that we could at least match up in the trenches and then we’ll figure out the rest when the game starts.”
<br><br> 
Staff and players return to work Monday, and the Huskies don’t play again until Sept. 21, when they host Buffalo in their MAC opener. I asked Hammock how he could prevent what might be natural human instinct — a letdown next time out.
<br><br> 
“We prepared for this since January,” he said. “I’m talking about handling success. I’m talking about handling failure. It’s the next-play mentality. The next-day mentality. Flush it and move on. We’ve already had that training and they’ve been around here long enough to understand.
<br><br> 
“We have always talked about the fight for consistency, so my message will not change. We have to fight to be consistent, and part of being consistent is building your routine, sticking to your routine and then obviously moving forward.”
<br><br> 
That’s what Hammock was doing as he finished going through game tape — moving forward — but it’s a time-consuming project. It was a 2½-hour bus ride back from South Bend. He spent the entire ride answering more than 300 text messages.
<br><br> 
“I never wanted to be a guy that didn’t respond to people, no matter what level I was at,” he said. “Because when I was a young coach and you reach out to other coaches and they don’t respond — I never wanted someone to have that feeling toward me.
<br><br> 
“It’s just an acknowledgment: ‘Hey, I got your message.’ I try to be conscientious because I think that’s important in this profession.”
<br><br> 
And now Hammock and the Huskies are on to the Buffalo game with a little — OK, a lot — more attention on his program.
<br><br> 
10a. Explosive plays were limited for the Bears. They really didn’t have any except for the 20-yard run by D’Andre Swift. That’s a key statistical category for defensive coaches. They’re more concerned with limiting big plays than they are third-down rankings, run defense stats or just about anything else. Caleb Williams and the Bears will have to be more explosive.
<br><br> 
10b. Keep an eye on Titans defensive coordinator Dennard Wilson to become a candidate for head-coaching openings in the near future. Wilson, who was a pro scout for the Bears from 2008 through 2011, has been rising the ranks as an assistant coach, working for the Rams in St. Louis and Los Angeles, the New York Jets, the Philadelphia Eagles and last year the Baltimore Ravens. This is the first time Wilson, 42, has served as a coordinator. Word is some within the Eagles organization were upset Wilson wasn’t promoted to coordinator after the 2022 season, leading him to depart for Baltimore, where he worked with All-Pro safety Kyle Hamilton in 2023.
<br><br> 
10c. Strong safety Jaquan Brisker had 10 tackles, five of them solo, and I thought defensive tackle Gervon Dexter showed up pretty well. Dexter had four stops, one sack and two quarterback hits. That’s a nice start for a second-year player who had a solid second half last season.
<br><br> 
10d. The Houston Texans opened as 6½-point favorites over the Bears at Westgate SuperBook in Las Vegas for Sunday night’s game at NRG Stadium.

        <p>10 thoughts after the Chicago Bears reached the end of the teardown phase for general manager Ryan Poles, losing to the Minnesota Vikings 29-13 on Sunday at Soldier Field to close the season at 3-14 and on a club-record 10-game losing streak.</p>

        <h2>1. As Bears players were filtering into the locker room, the Houston Texans were putting the finishing touches on an improbable rally in Indianapolis.</h2>

        <p>Facing fourth-and-20 from the Colts 28-yard line in the final minute, Texans quarterback Davis Mills backed up to the 40 and heaved a pass to the end zone that went through the hands of leaping Colts cornerback Rodney Thomas II and right to tight end Jordan Akins for a touchdown. Mills then connected with Akins for a 2-point conversion, and like that, the Texans won 32-31, delivering the Bears the No. 1 pick in the draft and dropping Houston to No. 2.</p>

        <p>I can’t recall something this wacky in the battle to the bottom for the top pick. The Texans led 24-14 until the final minute of the third quarter. Things looked pretty good for the Bears to secure the top pick as they struggled to move the ball with Nathan Peterman and Tim Boyle playing quarterback in place of Justin Fields.</p>

        <p>Then the Colts scored 17 unanswered points to lead 31-24 with a little more than three minutes remaining. Lovie Smith’s Texans chose the high road, battled to the end and wound up winning to improve to 3-13-1, a half-game better than the Bears.</p>

        <p>The Bears now own the No. 1 pick for the first time since 1947 and head into the offseason with more than $115 million in salary-cap space. I don’t believe this is how general manager Ryan Poles and his staff, along with coach Matt Eberflus, drew it up last winter and spring as they were getting situated in their roles and planning for the 2022 season. You don’t go into a year figuring you will be 32nd out of 32 teams.</p>

        <p>They were looking to establish their program, turn an older roster into a younger one, get the cap situation straightened out and discover building blocks for the future. Most pegged the Bears as a five- or six-win team. The schedule was supposed to be much more favorable, or at least that’s how it looked back in the spring when you considered how their opponents finished in 2021. What was projected to be the eighth-easiest schedule turned out to be the most difficult in the league.</p>

        <p>[ [Don’t miss] Chicago Bears — with an assist from Lovie Smith — leave their season-ending loss with a reason to celebrate: the No. 1 draft pick ]</p>

        <p>There’s a long offseason ahead to dissect how many building blocks Poles and Eberflus uncovered and how much better those players can be in 2023 with improved talent around them.</p>

        <p>Offensive coordinator Luke Getsy and quarterbacks coach Andrew Janocko spoke in the last few days about the work ahead for Fields, who had a season filled with highlight-reel moments leading the league’s No. 1 rushing offense. There were big throws from time to time, but the Bears readily admit their offensive formula for this season isn’t meant for sustainable success.</p>

        <p>There is optimism Fields can be a more dynamic player after a busy offseason for Poles and his staff. You will hear time and again between now and September how Fields’ third season will be critical for his future. That will be the No. 1 story at Halas Hall next season, and that’s why it’s so fascinating what the Bears will do with the No. 1 pick in addition to how Poles approaches free agency. If Fields was set up to fail in 2022, he has to be given a chance to thrive in 2023.</p>

        <p>Last January, a realistic look at the Bears told you there was a long road ahead to relevancy. That’s why I asked Poles and Eberflus at their introductory news conference about the length of the contracts Chairman George McCaskey gave them. That question is still pertinent because, as we’ve seen, this is a complete overhaul and the easy part — swinging the sledgehammer and taking the parts you ripped down out to the dumpster — is over.</p>

        <p>Bears coach Matt Eberflus walks off the field after a 29-13 loss to the Vikings at Soldier Field on Jan. 8, 2023.</p>

        <p>The acumen of Poles and his staff is what we all will be watching and evaluating now. How is that going to look?</p>

        <p>“High confidence, no question,” Eberflus said. “The first thing of a personnel manager is the ability to pick players, and he can do that. The place where he came from (the Kansas City Chiefs), he has shown that this year already and we look at the guys the same way. We like long, lean, fast, physical players. We’re excited about getting that going.”</p>

        <p>Everyone has a slightly different take, but the overriding feeling I get from the fan base is that the Bears have wrapped up one of the most positive three-win seasons in recent NFL history. Optimism abounds, and if Fields takes major strides forward, that will be the biggest piece. But the roster has holes all over the place.</p>

        <p>I imagine Poles’ primary goal will be to overhaul the lines on both sides of the ball, and that’s what a veteran personnel man I chatted with Thursday said.</p>

        <p>“Knowing that you’re not going to rebuild this thing in one year, I would spend a lot of resources on the fronts,” he said. “And then try to hit on some skill guys late in the draft. You’re much more likely to find skill in the fourth through seventh rounds than you are to find legit O-line and D-line guys.</p>

        <p>“I still believe in building out from the lines. The analytics have crept in, a priority is put on skill and receivers and I get all of that, but in Chicago and the way they are going to have to win games and the games they play in crappy weather, I would build it inside-out.”</p>

        <p>The challenge is finding a mix of free agents and draft picks to add, and when we get to mid-March, the free-agent class might look like a department store that’s sold out of many in-demand items.</p>

        <p>[ [Don’t miss] Chicago Bears have had only 2 No. 1 draft picks in team history — and both were disappointing ]</p>

        <p>“You’ve gotten some contract extensions in the last couple weeks and you’re always going to have four to eight franchise-tag guys, and it’s a bad class for free agency to begin with,” the scout said. “You get down past all that and then what’s left? Anybody that is good character in this market, they’re going to get re-signed by their own club or get franchised.</p>

        <p>“There might be a few that squeak through, and in the world they’re going to live in, everyone makes such a big deal about having a ton of cap space — it’s not always the best thing. All you’re going to do is overpay a ton of guys.”</p>

        <p>The scout called the projected group of free-agent wide receivers the worst he ever has seen. Unless Odell Beckham Jr., who has torn the same ACL twice, wants to join a rebuilding offense, the best wide receiver available might be Jakobi Meyers of the New England Patriots.</p>

        <p>“I actually like Chase Claypool better than Jakobi Meyers,” the scout said.</p>

        <p>Circling back to the lines, I chatted with an assistant GM and he praised the Bears for rolling with fifth-round pick Braxton Jones at left tackle this season. He liked Jones in the pre-draft process and used the word “intentional” in describing what the Bears did by thrusting young players such as Jones into primary roles. More on Jones in a little bit, but this guy’s take was that the Bears will look to make some moves in free agency but that Poles will be draft-driven in working to climb out of the hole in the NFC North.</p>

        <p>“Things can turn quickly in the NFL, faster than you think at times,” he said. “They might not be good next season, but sometimes things can flip in a hurry.”</p>

        <p>The hard work is just beginning.</p>

        <p>It will be one of the most repeated questions in the pre-draft season, which is almost as long and grueling as the regular season. The first option, of course, is to take a marquee player at the top of the draft and hope he is an impact player from Day 1.</p>

        <p>The top two picks last year were Travon Walker, whom the Jacksonville Jaguars are using at outside linebacker, and Detroit Lions defensive end Aidan Hutchinson. Walker had 3½ sacks, 10 quarterback hits, one interception and one forced fumble. Hutchinson finished with 9½ sacks, 15 QB hits and three interceptions.</p>

        <p>“You can argue both (Alabama edge rusher Will Anderson and Georgia defensive tackle Jalen Carter) are more talented,” a college scouting director told me. “Hutchinson’s calling card was his effort and his motor and all that stuff. He was a shorter-arm guy; there’s going to be some limitations. And then Walker was a huge projection. You’re drafting the athlete. When I went there, I’m like, ‘Is he a five-technique? Is he an outside linebacker?’ Ton of talent but a ton of projection.</p>

        <p>“The two guys this year, you know exactly what they are. Jalen Carter is as talented of a human being as you will find. The problem is that he’s not a character guy and there is a major bust factor with D-linemen that don’t have great character. There’s risk there but a lot of teams are willing to take it.</p>

        <p>“Will Anderson is not like a (Nick) Bosa or a Chase Young in terms of his get-off or his bend. He is just an ass kicker. He is a fighter. He’s tougher than hell. He is the alpha in a locker room that is all alphas. He’s the lead dog.</p>

        <p>“They’re all different. These two guys, I think it’s a little clearer than last year in those top two defensive guys. This year has got three quarterbacks. That is the rub there.”</p>

        <p>[ [Don’t miss] Alabama’s Bryce Young and Will Anderson declare for the NFL draft — and either could be the No. 1 pick ]</p>

        <p>Carter did not flash in the College Football Playoff semifinal victory over Ohio State. He looked a little heavy and wasn’t explosive. Personnel men I have spoken to are intrigued by Carter but say there’s a lot of work to do to learn more about him.</p>

        <p>For those wondering what Poles could turn the No. 1 pick into in terms of a trade, that’s where the quarterbacks come into play. From Nos. 2 through 9 in the draft order, a bunch of teams will be in the market for a quarterback. There will be veteran movement with guys such as Derek Carr, Jimmy Garoppolo and others. Tom Brady, anyone? But the Texans (No. 2), Colts (4), Seattle Seahawks (5), Lions (6), Las Vegas Raiders (7), Atlanta Falcons (8) and Carolina Panthers (9th) all could be interested in drafting a quarterback.</p>

        <p>The Lions probably were encouraged by Jared Goff this season and might look to use that pick to help a porous defense. The Seahawks could re-sign Geno Smith. Maybe one or two of those teams goes for a veteran. Still, that leaves a handful of teams in need of a quarterback. Want to have the top choice at the position? Probably need to get ahead of the Texans, right?</p>

        <p>A lot of mock drafts have linked the Texans to Alabama quarterback Bryce Young for months. The Crimson Tide website lists him at 6 feet, 194 pounds. Multiple scouts I spoke with said the buzz in NFL circles is Young is probably closer to 185 pounds. That would make him an absolute outlier as an NFL prospect. Teams have charts to measure the size of prospects — height, weight, length, hand size.</p>

        <p>“He wouldn’t even be on our graph at that size,” one scout said of his team’s chart for quarterback height and weight.</p>

        <p>How much of an outlier would Young be at 185 pounds? Or even 194? According to Pro Football Reference, three quarterbacks who weighed 210 or less have been drafted in the first round since 2000.</p>

        <p>Kyler Murray, Arizona Cardinals, No. 1, 5-10, 207</p>
        <p>Johnny Manziel, Cleveland Browns, No. 22, 6-0, 207</p>
        <p>Michael Vick, Falcons, No. 1, 6-0, 210</p>
        <p>“I think the Kentucky kid, Will Levis, is the top quarterback,” the scouting director said. “He’s 6-foot-3. He’s almost 240. He’s got a huge arm. His mental makeup is top of the line. I think he’s going to be a good pro.</p>

        <p>“Is Bryce Young a better player? More exciting? Absolutely. But he’s just not built. I think the Kentucky kid has the build, the strength and athleticism to not only avoid hits but take hits and be able to survive a 17-game season and have the arm strength to play in any kind of weather. I think he is the safest pick in terms of quarterbacks.”</p>

        <p>Young is intriguing, and scouts say he will get top marks for intangibles, playmaking ability and performance in clutch situations. He’s everything NFL teams are seeking in that regard. But Young’s size — he has a slender frame, so it’s not like he can get a lot bigger — would require whatever team chooses him to take a leap of faith.</p>

        <p>Some smart football folks have told me that when considering a quarterback from a college program that isn’t high-profile, you have to ask whether that player elevated his school to a level it hadn’t reached in a long time. Is that a fair question for Levis, who had some injuries this past season at Kentucky?</p>

        <p>[ [Don’t miss] Column: After a 10th straight loss, the Chicago Bears are No. 1 — in the NFL draft. Now the real work begins. ]</p>

        <p>“Would you say Josh Allen did that at Wyoming?” the scouting director responded. “He was a 58% completion guy, or whatever it was, and he didn’t light the world on fire. What he had was NFL talent, athleticism, size, strength, mental capacity, all that stuff. I think you need to factor it in a little bit and you can use that to help reduce the risk, but I don’t think that needs to be a factor where you say, ‘I’m not drafting that guy because he didn’t turn Kentucky into a top-10 team.’ Hell, Patrick Mahomes wasn’t taking Texas Tech to high-profile bowl games, was he?”</p>

        <p>Ohio State’s C.J. Stroud is the third top quarterback prospect. There are concerns about how he operates in the pocket, and he traditionally has not been great outside of the pocket. Yes, Stroud was terrific in the loss to Georgia, but the multiple scouts I chatted with all had him third in their evaluation. Of course, it takes only one team to fall in love with a player and have conviction.</p>

        <p>The first rule — and it’s true almost every year — is quarterbacks go early and they’re almost always overdrafted. Draft season will provide an extended period to evaluate them and the rest of the prospects.</p>

        <h2>3. Braxton Jones finished the season as the only offensive player on the field for every snap.</h2>

        <p>It’s a terrific accomplishment for the rookie, especially when considering how injuries rocked the offensive line for much of the season. Jones took a brief trip to the blue medical tent during Sunday’s game to have his hand inspected but didn’t miss any action. It’s notable the team didn’t have a single defensive player on the field for every snap, so, again, kudos to Jones for his durability.</p>

        <p>All of that playing time exposed Jones to just about everything a left tackle can see in the NFL. It’s possible the Bears believe Jones, with a strong offseason in the weight room and hard work on the field, can take steps forward to become the kind of player the team needs at the position. There is clearly more upside to him.</p>

        <p>Jones had games that went by quietly, always a good thing for a lineman, and others in which he looked overmatched, like last week’s loss in Detroit. That’s going to happen for first- and fifth-round picks, and considering where Jones was drafted, it’s fair to call his season a success.</p>

        <p>The Bears will conduct a thorough review of all players and positions. My hunch is they will try to provide Jones with competition for the starting job next season, something a couple of notches above signing 33-year-old Riley Reiff just before training camp. That’s not meant as a knock on Reiff, who wound up being serviceable at right tackle and provided value in the meeting room for young players. He was this year’s version of Jason Peters.</p>

        <p>[ [Don’t miss] Chicago Bears finish 3-14 — that’s the most losses in franchise history. Here’s how the 2022 season unfolded. ]</p>

        <p>But if you’re going to talk about making the offensive line a strength, a discussion needs to begin at the premier position. There’s one option who could reach free agency — and the Bears might be able to send a Brinks truck to bring him to Halas Hall: Chiefs left tackle Orlando Brown. It’s possible Kansas City signs him to a new contract or uses the franchise tag for a second year. Brown played on the tag for $16.6 million this season, and that figure will bump to nearly $20 million in 2023.</p>

        <p>Brown rejected a five-year, $95 million extension in the offseason because of how the proposed deal was structured. Ryan Poles and Bears co-director of personnel Trey Koziol know the ins and outs of Brown from their time in Kansas City, and a relationship might aid the Bears in pursuit of the player. Again, Brown would have to reach free agency, and the Chiefs, who are projected to be 14th in available salary-cap space according to spotrac.com, likely will be motivated to retain him.</p>

        <p>The Green Bay Packers already extended versatile offensive lineman Elgton Jenkins and the Browns re-upped right tackle Jack Conklin, preventing them from becoming coveted free agents. If the Bears cannot sign a plug-and-play left tackle in free agency, then you’re looking at the possibility of a high draft pick at the position or the hope that Jones gets stronger.</p>

        <h2>4. A striking statistic from the season was that the Bears finished minus-37 in sack differential.</h2>

        <p>Bears quarterback Justin Fields is helped up after being sacked in the third quarter on Dec. 18, 2022, at Soldier Field. </p>

        <p>According to WBBM-AM 780 statistical wiz Doug Colletti, the Bears are the first team since 1995 with 55 or more sacks allowed (57) and fewer than 22 sacks (20).</p>

        <p>More concerning is this was a historically bad passing offense in an era when you have to be able to throw the ball to win. Any way you slice it, the passing game was bad, and blame is shared by everyone — Justin Fields, the three other quarterbacks who played two games, the offensive line and the wide receivers, who struggled. Some take this as a criticism of Fields. Hardly. It’s an evaluation of the unit as a whole.</p>

        <p>This wasn’t just the 32nd-ranked passing offense this season. It was one of the worst in a long stretch. Since 1994, five teams have averaged less than 130.5 passing yards per game, where the Bears finished (starters in parentheses):</p>

        <p>2009: Browns (Brady Quinn, Derek Anderson), 129.8</p>
        <p>2005: San Francisco 49ers (Alex Smith, Tim Rattay, Ken Dorsey, Cody Pickett), 118.7</p>
        <p>2005: Bears (Kyle Orton), 125.1</p>
        <p>2000: Cincinnati Bengals (Akili Smith, Scott Mitchell), 121.6</p>
        <p>1999: Philadelphia Eagles (Donovan McNabb, Doug Pederson, Koy Detmer), 130.3</p>
        <p>Since 1990, five teams have been at or below 13.1 completions per game, where the Bears finished:</p>

        <p>2009: New York Jets (Mark Sanchez, Kellen Clemens), 13.1</p>
        <p>2005: 49ers, 12.8</p>
        <p>2001: Dallas Cowboys (Quincy Carter, Anthony Wright, Ryan Leaf, Clint Stoerner), 13.1</p>
        <p>2000: Bengals, 12.9</p>
        <p>1990: Raiders, (Jay Schroeder) 11.4</p>
        <p>Since the NFL went to a 16-game schedule in 1978, two teams have averaged less than 22.2 pass attempts:</p>

        <p>1990: Raiders, 21.0</p>
        <p>1978: Bears (Bob Avellini, Mike Phipps), 22.0</p>
        <p>The Bears have to be miles better throwing the football to get where they want to go. It will require new personnel on the line, and somehow, some way, Ryan Poles has to infuse the wide receiver room with improved talent. Fields has to be better, too, or the Bears offense will spin its wheels in mediocrity.</p>

        <h2>5. A league source indicated the Bears are not expected to send their coaching staff to the East-West Shrine Bowl later this month to coach during the week and in the Feb. 2 game.</h2>

        <p>Bears coach Matt Eberflus, center left, and offensive coordinator Luke Getsy, center right, work from the sideline in the first quarter against the Vikings at Soldier Field on Jan. 8, 2023.</p>

        <p>The NFL is rotating sending full coaching staffs to the East-West and the Senior Bowl beginning this year, and the Bears, with the No. 1 pick, were in position to be one of the two teams selected. Typically the two teams highest in the draft order that do not hire a new coaching staff are invited.</p>

        <p>With Lovie Smith getting fired in Houston late Sunday and other teams having already fired their coaches — or potentially waiting to do so Monday — it will be interesting to see which staffs are invited. The Raiders might be one. Just speculation on my part.</p>

        <p>[ [Don’t miss] Developer unveils video tour of ‘reimagined’ domed Soldier Field in ‘Hail Mary’ bid to keep Bears in Chicago ]</p>

        <p>[ [Don’t miss] Will the Chicago Bears leave Soldier Field for Arlington Heights? Here’s what to know. ]</p>

        <p>The Bears coaching staff has been going full speed for nearly a year now since Matt Eberflus assembled it and will need to complete season evaluations before getting vacation time. When the coaches return, the team is expected to dive into preparation for free agency, which will be a busy period with roster needs almost across the board and more than $100 million in available cap space.</p>

        <p>By skipping a week in Las Vegas for the East-West, the Bears will not interrupt that process and can transition into preparing for the scouting combine and college pro days.</p>

        <p>It makes sense, especially because the Senior Bowl assembled a stronger roster of players as usual. Last year 106 players who participated in the Senior Bowl were drafted and 45 had their names called in the first three rounds. Six were selected in the first round.</p>

        <p>The East-West put together a better game than usual last year as 45 players were drafted — a 55% uptick over the number drafted from the 2021 game. Patriots wide receiver Tyquan Thornton was a second-round pick, the highest selection of an East-West player since the Patriots chose quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo in the second round in 2012. But the Senior Bowl will have more talent to evaluate for the first two days of the draft (Rounds 1-3).</p>

        <p>The NFL has partnered with the East-West to add some synergy to the week in Las Vegas, which will host the Pro Bowl Games at the same time. Full NFL staffs will coach in the Senior Bowl in 2024. The Bears last coached in the Senior Bowl in 2017.</p>

        <h2>6. Evaluating offensive line play is a difficult task.</h2>

        <p>Grading players is guesswork when you don’t know the specific protection assignment on any given play. On occasion it’s obvious to anyone viewing where the blame lies. But more often than not, there is some gray involved. A full understanding requires knowing what the quarterback’s progression was and how the receivers executed their routes.</p>

        <p>You don’t need various rankings or grades to know the Bears were very poor in protecting Justin Fields and the other quarterbacks. What struck me back in July was when Ross Tucker, who has a network of podcasts and does work for CBS Sports, Audacy and Westwood One, stacked up the league’s 32 offensive lines and had the Bears last.</p>

        <p>“The Bears have the potential to not only have the worst offensive line in the NFL this year but maybe even the worst offensive line we’ve seen in the NFL in quite some time if their young tackles don’t come through,” Tucker wrote.</p>

        <p>[ [Don’t miss] How do the 2022 Chicago Bears compare with the worst teams in franchise history? A look at some of the ‘darkest and dreariest’ years. ]</p>

        <p>During the first week of training camp, I reached out to Tucker, who is always entertaining and informative. If you haven’t seen his #tuckspreads on social media, it’s amusing as he travels to pro and college stadiums. He’s a former offensive lineman, so he has a pretty good idea of what he’s looking at in the trenches — and he’s not a hot-take artist. Tucker gives you a measured take and works tirelessly to follow the entire league.</p>

        <p>“If (Fields) doesn’t have a lot of turnovers and he is getting the ball out quick, I feel like that will be considered a success no matter what the team’s record is or the stats because they’re just not very good around him,” Tucker told me after his rankings came out.</p>

        <p>“You can make a strong argument that they have the worst receiving corps and the worst offensive line in the NFL. It’s almost ... unconscionable that a first-round quarterback would be going into his second year and you could say that is what he is being surrounded by.”</p>

        <p>Turnovers were an issue for the Bears. Fields’ interception rate of 3.5% was 32nd out of 33 quarterbacks with a minimum of 200 attempts. Only the Cowboys’ Dak Prescott, who objectively had a very rough second half of the season, had a higher rate at 3.9%.</p>

        <p>Fields led the NFL with 16 fumbles and remarkably lost only two. He has 28 fumbles in 27 career games with seven lost, so ball security no doubt will be an offseason focus.</p>

        <p>The upshot? The Bears have a ton of work to do in improving the offensive line and adding targets for the quarterback. It’s probably a good idea to wait and see what predictions Tucker has in midsummer. Maybe he will have the Super Bowl LVIII winner — or at least a better review of the Bears offensive line.</p>

The great thing about the ‘No Name Football Podcast’ with Olin Kreutz, Jason McKie and James ‘Big Cat’ Williams, besides the anecdotes they share about their playing days, is you get an unvarnished take on the current state of the team from guys who went through all sorts of ups and downs in their careers.</h2>

        <p>Last week’s episode was an entertaining listen with McKie, a former fullback, calling Justin Fields the “cologne” for Halas Hall.</p>

        <p>“You get beat down by Detroit but spray a little Fields and it’s all better,” McKie said. “In years past, they would have been berated, shredded, especially with the way the media is here in Chicago. It’s the Fields cologne. It’s that quarterback that gives you optimism that if you put pieces around him and he can develop, they can be something.”</p>

        <p>The three former players dispute the idea that the Bears have established a culture this season, and I agree. You can’t wave the culture banner coming off a three-win season. That doesn’t work, especially when there will be another heavy roster churn in 2023 and likely again in 2024. If you want to credit the players for their effort throughout a long season, that’s fair.</p>

        <p>“Listen, I’m not Justin Fields. I’m not the starting quarterback. That’s a little different. But he’s not the only one (not playing). It’s interesting. Their young guys, their young leaders, Teven Jenkins, Justin Fields, the guys you are kind of looking to, they’ve never finished 17 games. This is a total rebuild we’re watching here. It’s piqued my interest.</p>

        <p>“It’s one of the most interesting things I’ve ever watched in the NFL. I was saying this the other day, what is this, ‘It’s all right to lose’? Like don’t worry about it, we’re building for next year. I told them, ‘Remember when it all started where everyone got a trophy? Everyone won the game?’ I know we’re losing nine in a row but did you see the 60-yard run by (Fields)? What did someone say the other day? ‘It’s been fun to watch.’ All that being said, now the hard part starts.”</p>

        <p>The possibility that Fields is the centerpiece required to turn things around has made the Bears a must-view even as the team struggled to the finish line.</p>

        <p>“I’m not saying it’s wrong, all I’m saying from an old, calloused ballplayer, it’s interesting,” Kreutz said. “They got this brand-new perfume, Justin Fields, they spray it. They spray it all over the place. The press conferences are like kumbaya.</p>

        <p>“As an old ballplayer, you’re taught every game matters. You’re building a culture. Winning matters. Obviously, you see the other side. We’re older now. You see they’re building a team. You see it from the organizational perspective. Things are falling into place. The plan — the evil plan — it is sort of falling into place. That is what is weirding me out.</p>

        <p>“But 2008 Chris Williams, 2011 Gabe Carimi, 2012 Shea McCllelin, 2013 Kyle Long, 2014 Kyle Fuller, 2015 Kevin White, 2016 Leonard Floyd, 2017 Mitch Trubisky, 2018 Roquan Smith, 2021 Justin Fields. There are not a lot of cornerstones in that building. (Ryan) Poles and them are going to have to do something that hasn’t been done in a while.</p>

        <p>“I will say this: I am interested. I didn’t think I would be. I’m an old-school football guy. I understand what people are saying. They were weirdly fun.”</p>

        <h2>8. One way to take some hits off Justin Fields next season would be to start throwing to the running backs more.</h2>

        <p>That’s something the offense didn’t do enough of as David Montgomery finished with a team-high 34 receptions out of the backfield. Montgomery had six games with two targets or fewer, excluding the Week 3 win over the Texans in which he exited with a knee injury. That’s not enough. Khalil Herbert finished with nine catches, and the team’s running backs had a total of 46.</p>

        <p>The Bears, who entered Week 18 ranked 21st in the NFL in target percentage for running backs at 17.5%, were pretty efficient when they did throw to backs. They had only 61 targets for running backs, so a 73.8% completion percentage is a positive.</p>

        <p>Montgomery isn’t a dynamic receiver. No one will mistake him for Austin Ekeler or Christian McCaffrey but he’s solid. He caught 42 passes a season ago, when he missed two games, and had 54 receptions in 2020. Pass catching is a deficiency for Herbert, but he still caught nine of 12 targets for 57 yards. Since 2006, the only season the Bears’ leading receiver out of the backfield had fewer than 34 catches was 2016 (Jordan Howard with 29).</p>

        <p>One explanation for the backs not catching more passes is the Bears probably leaned on max protection a little more than they would have preferred, keeping a back in to support pass blocking. Another is that Fields didn’t get to his check-down targets quickly enough, resulting in hits in the pocket or on a scramble. If the primary read is covered, get it to the back and check down for 6 yards, then move to the next play. That saves the quarterback from having to run and being exposed to defenders.</p>

        <p>Offensive coordinator Luke Getsy was part of an offense in Green Bay that featured running back Aaron Jones as a pass catcher at times. Who knows what shape the backfield takes in 2023 with Montgomery headed to free agency. But the Bears can take some hits off Fields by using the backs more in the passing game.</p>

        <h2>9. The Bears got Equanimeous St. Brown under contract for next season.</h2>

That’s a slight raise from the $965,000 St. Brown made in 2022, and with him agreeing to a deal before the season ended, it’s fair to assume a portion of the contract is guaranteed.</p>

        <p>St. Brown finished the season with 21 receptions for 323 yards and one touchdown. He had a season-high four receptions in the Oct. 24 victory at New England and 85 yards in the Dec. 4 loss to the Packers. Those numbers were fourth on the team in receptions and third in yardage.</p>

        <p>St. Brown isn’t the only player coming out of contract whom the Bears made a run at re-signing. I am told fullback Khari Blasingame was a candidate for a potential deal, the parameters of which are not known. The guess would be another modest one-year deal.</p>

        <p>Blasingame, who turns 27 on July 1, may want to see what else could be out there. A player eliminates 31 potential offers when he re-signs with a team just before the end of the season. Blasingame has played a minor role in the offense, but he has been durable, missing only one game with an illness, while averaging a little more than 10 offensive snaps per game with a consistent role on special teams.</p>

        <p>“I don’t have any comment on that right now,” Blasingame said of negotiations. “I’m just kind of soaking in the last time playing with this exact group of guys.”</p>

        <h2>10. The Bears have 30 players who will be free agents.</h2>

        <p>Twenty-three will be unrestricted free agents, a list headed by running back David Montgomery. Center Sam Mustipher, running back Darrynton Evans, defensive tackle Andrew Brown and linebacker Javin White will be restricted free agents. Cornerback Josh Blackwell, guard/center Dieter Eiselen and defensive end Andre Anthony will be exclusive rights free agents.</p>

        <p>QB: Nathan Peterman and Tim Boyle</p>
        <p>RB: David Montgomery</p>

        <p>10a. The Bears had 33 players spend time on the practice squad this season. They had 34 in 2021 and 33 in 2020, two seasons that included many moves because of COVID-19. The NFL voted to expand the developmental squad to 12 players in 2020, then bumped that number to 16 the last two years to make it easier for teams to navigate the pandemic. It was decided the league would stay at 16 this season.</p>

        <p>Thirteen players who spent time on the practice squad appeared in a game: tight ends Chase Allen and Jake Tonges, offensive lineman Dieter Eiselen, quarterback Nathan Peterman, running back Darrynton Evans, linebackers Joe Thomas and DeMarquis Gates, kicker Michael Badgley, defensive lineman Gerri Green and defensive backs Harrison Hand, A.J. Thomas, Adrian Colbert and Greg Stroman. Twenty-one practice-squad players saw game action in 2021 and only 10 saw the field in 2020.</p>

        <p>Here’s a little nugget: The NFL originally formed practice squads in 1990 at the urging of New Orleans Saints GM Jim Finks, who was head of the league’s competition committee. Finks, of course, was an architect of the Bears’ Super Bowl XX team.</p>

        <p>Total number of Bears practice-squad players the last eight seasons:</p>

        <p>2022: 33</p>
        <p>2021: 34</p>
        <p>2020: 33</p>
        <p>2019: 20</p>
        <p>2018: 13</p>
        <p>2017: 27</p>
        <p>2016: 30</p>
        <p>2015: 30</p>
        <p>Look for a good handful of practice-squad players to sign reserve/future contracts in the coming days.</p>

        <p>10b. The Bears allowed opponents to convert 49% of third downs. Since 1996, there have been three worse figures: 2021 Chargers (49.5%), 2020 Panthers (49.2%), 2011 Chargers (49.2%). That’s a reason to consider drafting a front-seven player with the No. 1 pick.</p>

        <p>10c. Sunday’s results finalized the Bears’ list of 2023 opponents. Bears fans have a strong presence on the road, and there are some great trips next season.</p>

        <p>Besides the usual home/away dates with NFC North rivals, the Bears will host the Falcons, Panthers, Denver Broncos, Raiders and Cardinals. They will play road games against the Chiefs, Chargers, Saints, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Browns and Washington Commanders.</p>

        <p>10d. General manager Ryan Poles and coach Matt Eberflus are scheduled to meet with the media at 10:30 a.m. Tuesday.</p>

        <p>10e. It’s draft (and free agency) season now. Buckle up.</p>
