So that was really good.”</p><p data-reader-unique-id="228">Chairman George McCaskey entered the locker room shortly after the game,  which I can’t recall seeing him do  in the past.

Niners quarterback Trey Lance was battered and looked skittish way too often, dropping his eyes in the pocket.</p><p data-reader-unique-id="244">Eberflus talked about a 24-hour rule — and that’s  in every coach’s playbook. Enjoy the victory and then be prepared to report to work Monday and turn the page to the next opponent. One thing is for sure, it’s a lot easier to coach corrections coming off a victory than it is a loss.</p><p data-reader-unique-id="245">“We’ve got a lot of young players on our squad (and) they need to take what they have learned from this game and get better,”  Eberflus said. “Good, bad or indifferent, they have to get better. And our individual (practice period) on Wednesday will reflect that. Whatever they’re working on, we’re going to have a good 15, 20 minutes of individual (time) to work on the fundamentals because that’s what wins football games. That’s going to be a big part of what we do here as coaches as we make these corrections from this game.”</p><p data-reader-unique-id="246">This might sound like straight coachspeak and come across as a little monotonous, but it’s something Eberflus has referenced before and it’s worth explaining here. He is willing to sacrifice snaps in team periods — 11-on-11 football —  to make sure his players are dialed in on technique. It’s something that Eberflus believes in and that the Bears will stick with weekly.</p><h2 data-reader-unique-id="247">2.

The 49ers led 7-0 when they got the ball to start the third quarter. Jauan Jennings got free behind rookie cornerback Kyler Gordon for a 44-yard gain on third-and-6, and pretty soon they had first-and-goal at the 5-yard line.</p><p data-reader-unique-id="259">A touchdown there would have created what looked like an insurmountable lead given the way the first half went on offense. Roquan Smith stopped Jeff Wilson for a 3-yard gain on first down. Jaquan Brisker dropped Wilson for a 2-yard loss on the next play, and Smith and rookie defensive end Dominique Robinson — more on him in a  bit — combined to sack Trey Lance on third down, forcing a 25-yard Robbie Gould field goal.</p><p data-reader-unique-id="260">The Bears got some nice breaks on the ensuing possession that led to the Pettis score. First, 49ers linebacker Dre Greenlaw was penalized 15 yards for a facemask infraction after a run for no gain by David Montgomery on third-and-4. That’s a punt there without the penalty.</p><p data-reader-unique-id="261">On the next snap, former Bears safety Tashaun Gipson dropped  a potential interception on a pass to the boundary  to Equanimeous St. Brown. Montgomery ran for no gain, and it was third-and-10 from the Bears 49-yard line with the Niners in Cover-3.</p><p data-reader-unique-id="262">Pettis was running an in-breaking route on the back side and Darnell Mooney was attempting to clear the middle of the field by running a seam route. Fields had a check-down to tight end Cole Kmet early in the play. It’s a decision Fields could have made — get Kmet the ball and see if he can break a tackle to  move the chains.</p><p data-reader-unique-id="263">Fields’ eyes were downfield when he felt pressure. Nick Bosa and Arik Armstead ran a twist/stunt from a tilted front designed to create one-on-ones. Bosa slanted inside and Armstead went upfield. Left tackle Braxton Jones eventually dropped his head, and Bosa did a quick arm-over to apply pressure. That’s when Fields spun out.</p><p data-reader-unique-id="264" style="font-style: italic;"><span data-reader-unique-id="265">[&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/bears/ct-chicago-bears-justin-fields-slide-celebration-20220911-2gngo7c2tjf23af7qxoi3edkia-story.html#nt=interstitial-manual" aria-label="Open related story" data-reader-unique-id="266">[Don’t miss] Justin Fields’ Slip ‘N Slide celebration — ‘a snapshot moment’ — caps the Chicago Bears’ wild, wet comeback win</a><span data-reader-unique-id="267">&nbsp;]</span></p><p data-reader-unique-id="268">“I honestly didn’t see where (Fields) was when I turned around,” Pettis said. “I saw everybody flowing that way so I figured he was over there, but I couldn’t see what was going on. All of a sudden it kind of opened up a little bit and I saw him stand up to throw.”</p><p data-reader-unique-id="269">By then, the underneath curl defender, Greenlaw, had vacated the space. He had no idea Pettis was behind him and when he saw Montgomery move to the middle of the field, he pursued Montgomery. There was no one left for the 49ers as cornerback Charvarius Ward left to take Mooney on the seam route. Safety Talanoa Hufanga came down as a hook defender and was just running around.</p><p data-reader-unique-id="270">There  was no one within 30 yards of Pettis, and if the Niners are going to blame anyone, it’s probably Greenlaw. He has to find someone to plaster and realize there could be a player behind him.</p><div data-reader-unique-id="271"><figure data-reader-unique-id="272"><picture data-reader-unique-id="273"><source srcset="https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/Jpv6z4kbxVCQq-jIJGGpe6F9tys=/1440x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tronc/UE4POUBARJCCJLYSRBR2JJ57MA.jpg" media="screen and (min-width: 992px)" data-reader-unique-id="274"><source srcset="https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/iUFAyPERWonzZBP4IpTPYMr5_kk=/1024x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tronc/UE4POUBARJCCJLYSRBR2JJ57MA.jpg" media="screen and (min-width: 768px)" data-reader-unique-id="275"><source srcset="https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/lOpfTz2-VCxb_-c6Jnz3kVnOMqg=/768x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tronc/UE4POUBARJCCJLYSRBR2JJ57MA.jpg" media="screen and (min-width: 0px)" data-reader-unique-id="276"><img src="https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/Jpv6z4kbxVCQq-jIJGGpe6F9tys=/1440x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tronc/UE4POUBARJCCJLYSRBR2JJ57MA.jpg" width="1440" height="0" loading="lazy" data-reader-unique-id="277" class="extendsBeyondTextColumn" style="width: 787.546875px; margin-inline-start: -70px;"></picture><figcaption data-reader-unique-id="278"><p data-reader-unique-id="279"><span data-reader-unique-id="280">Bears quarterback Justin Fields and teammates splash into the end zone as they celebrate their Week 1 win on Sept. 11, 2022, at Soldier Field. </span>(Brian Cassella / Chicago Tribune)</p></figcaption></figure></div><p data-reader-unique-id="281">“Normally, no one throws it back across the field like that,” Pettis said. “I think everyone just flowed with Justin when he rolled out, completely just forgot about me and left me alone, disregarded (me).

They’re like general scramble rules. If you’re the low receiver, you go high. If you’re the high receiver, you go low. Or if you are low, you push up a couple yards and break back down. You normally don’t try to work back across the field to the quarterback.</p><p data-reader-unique-id="290">“Those are just generic rules that everybody basically  goes by. I don’t know if it was from playing basketball or something, (but) being able to find spaces is relatively easy for me. Being able to feel that space.”</p><p data-reader-unique-id="291">St. Brown was able to make a key block as Pettis neared the end zone, and it turned into a huge play for an offense that had mustered only 74 yards on its first 33 snaps.</p><p data-reader-unique-id="292">“Even after that play we’re still up and we’ve got full control,” 49ers linebacker Fred Warner said. “We just kept shooting ourselves in the foot with bad penalties. What was it — 100 yards (actually 99) in penalties? That’s not winning football. We were minus-1 in turnovers. Those things will always hold up forever in ball.”</p><p data-reader-unique-id="293" style="font-style: italic;"><span data-reader-unique-id="294">[&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/bears/ct-chicago-bears-george-mccaskey-ted-phillips-20220909-7tshaesgsvb4vkqa6vwnia3z7y-story.html#nt=interstitial-manual" aria-label="Open related story" data-reader-unique-id="295">[Don’t miss] Q&amp;A with George McCaskey and Ted Phillips: On search for new Chicago Bears president, potential stadium in Arlington Heights and much more</a><span data-reader-unique-id="296">&nbsp;]</span></p><p data-reader-unique-id="297">The 49ers might have felt like they remained in total control with a 10-7 lead, but that slipped quickly. At the end of the third quarter, the Bears started a possession on their 16 and Fields immediately hooked up with Byron Pringle for a 22-yard pass along the sideline. The 49ers would have gotten off the field after stopping Fields on a third-and-9 run that gained 5 yards, but Ward was called for holding, another costly penalty.</p><p data-reader-unique-id="298">A second roughing call against Fields, this one on linebacker Azeez Al-Shaair, gave the Bears another 15 yards, and pretty soon Fields hit St. Brown for  an 18-yard touchdown when the Niners blew coverage on St. Brown and Pringle, leaving both wide open. With 12:45 to play, the Bears led 14-10 and the momentum  the Niners had for the majority of the game was gone.</p><p data-reader-unique-id="299">“We always talk about doing right longer,” 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan said. “Today was the exact opposite. Looking at the amount of penalties we had compared to them, the turnovers compared to them and then the timing of those penalties were crucial.

I felt like I was a little bit late, whereas he was right on time. It was a bad set. I let him get in my chest and it was kind of over from there. The biggest thing on that, the thing I took to heart, was don’t let one turn into two or three.

The Raiders reached by selecting him with the 17th pick in 2021.</p><p data-reader-unique-id="438">The Bears feel like they have quality scouting reports on Leatherwood. Assistant offensive line coach Austin King was the Raiders tight ends coach  last season. Defensive line coach Travis Smith was the Raiders assistant defensive line coach. So the Bears had two assistants to turn to for an evaluation of what Leatherwood was like on the practice field and inside the facility.</p><p data-reader-unique-id="439">The tape? It wasn’t good. In fact, it was bad. Leatherwood started all 17 regular-season games  last season. He struggled mightily at right tackle in the first four games and was moved inside to guard with the hope he wouldn’t be as exposed there. Guards Richie Incognito and Denzelle Good suffered injuries, so as much as  the Raiders wanted to,  they couldn’t remove Leatherwood from the lineup.</p><p data-reader-unique-id="440">“The thing that was hard to explain is how a player that is such a good athlete could wind up in such a bad position so regularly,” said one source with knowledge of Leatherwood’s rookie season. “It’s like he struggled instinctively. I don’t know how else to explain it, but this kid went through 17 games and didn’t get any better.”</p><p data-reader-unique-id="441" style="font-style: italic;"><span data-reader-unique-id="442">[&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/about/news-alerts/#nt=interstitial-manual" aria-label="Open related story" data-reader-unique-id="443">[Sign up] Get our Chicago Bears alerts on your phone, desktop and inbox</a><span data-reader-unique-id="444">&nbsp;]</span></p><p data-reader-unique-id="445">The other factor to consider here is offensive line coach Chris Morgan considers Tom Cable, the Raiders offensive line coach last season, one of his two biggest mentors in the NFL. So it’s fair to assume Morgan did due diligence with  Cable when the Bears discussed the possibility of claiming Leatherwood and inheriting a rookie contract that carries through the 2024 season and includes $5.9 million in guarantees.</p><p data-reader-unique-id="446">If Leatherwood turns into a player — even a rank-and-file starter — for the Bears at some point, it will be a modest investment. And with the Bears having a ton of salary-cap room looking ahead to 2023, it’s not like the risk  of taking on the contract of a player who really struggled as a rookie  would set the team back. Sure, the Bears could have decided not to claim Leatherwood and then attempted to sign him as a free agent, but there might have been competition for him at that point.</p><div data-reader-unique-id="447"><figure class="auxiliary" data-reader-unique-id="448" style="width: 50%;"><picture data-reader-unique-id="449"><source srcset="https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/etSRRsFYpVKIlYQREdAFCgdB3bA=/1440x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tronc/YIPBN5XPNW7G5YEUFEDNQQRPZQ.jpg" media="screen and (min-width: 992px)" data-reader-unique-id="450"><source srcset="https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/jtG3sKde3b51WL8rzKpKg8F_v5k=/1024x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tronc/YIPBN5XPNW7G5YEUFEDNQQRPZQ.jpg" media="screen and (min-width: 768px)" data-reader-unique-id="451"><source srcset="https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/D-wXoOfFjTQ2EK5AKN-f2Z53aAo=/768x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tronc/YIPBN5XPNW7G5YEUFEDNQQRPZQ.jpg" media="screen and (min-width: 0px)" data-reader-unique-id="452"><img src="https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/etSRRsFYpVKIlYQREdAFCgdB3bA=/1440x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tronc/YIPBN5XPNW7G5YEUFEDNQQRPZQ.jpg" width="1440" height="0" loading="lazy" data-reader-unique-id="453" class="extendsBeyondTextColumn" style="width: 787.546875px; margin-inline-start: -70px;"></picture><figcaption data-reader-unique-id="454"><p data-reader-unique-id="455"><span data-reader-unique-id="456">Raiders offensive tackle Alex Leatherwood watches action against the Patriots during the first half of a preseason game on Aug. 26, 2022. </span>(Rick Scuteri/AP)</p></figcaption></figure></div><p data-reader-unique-id="457">The Bears have been working Leatherwood at right tackle with the reserves,  but I wouldn’t read too much into that. They’re getting him up to speed with the playbook. Maybe they will seriously look at him as a right tackle in the future. Perhaps they’ll decide he would be better inside at guard, or it’s possible factors with existing linemen dictate where he goes. For the time being, they’re getting him adjusted to the playbook and how they want to practice, and  that  can be a challenge as  teams are allowed to practice with full pads only once per week during the regular season.</p><p data-reader-unique-id="458">Leatherwood has spoken to reporters once since he arrived and said he’s not really concerned about what went wrong in Las Vegas.</p><p data-reader-unique-id="459">“I’m more concerned with the future and the things that I’ve got going on here now,” he said.</p><p data-reader-unique-id="460">Leatherwood and the Bears should be concerned about what didn’t go right a year ago so both parties can avoid those pitfalls. If he had shown improvement in the spring and summer, I don’t think a new regime for the Raiders would have looked to trade him so quickly and then cut him. Learning from past mistakes is  the best way to avoid repeating them.</p><p data-reader-unique-id="461">There’s no timeline to get him on the field. This is a long play with him being under contract for two more years after this season. Maybe he’ll get to the point this season where he’s ready for action, and perhaps that would coincide with a need  on the line. There’s no way of telling.</p><p data-reader-unique-id="462">“Alex has done a great job so far with us,” Morgan said. “He’s working really hard. He’s done a heck of a job connecting with the guys. We’re glad to have him. ‘Embrace everything and let’s roll.’ It’s really an easy message (for him).”</p><p data-reader-unique-id="463">It will be interesting to see how things unfold on the line over the course of the season. Teven Jenkins and Lucas Patrick rotated at right guard throughout  Sunday’s game. How that position will be handled next week remains to be seen. At some point do the Bears want to evaluate Leatherwood?</p><p data-reader-unique-id="464">The Bears drafted four offensive linemen in April. Doug Kramer was placed on season-ending injured reserve. There are three second-year players in Jenkins, Larry Borom and Leatherwood. How many of these young guys will the coaching staff feel it has a good handle on by the end of the year?</p><h2 data-reader-unique-id="465">9.

He’s athletic but he didn’t hurt the Bears pulling the ball down and running like Justin Fields did to the 49ers.</p><p data-reader-unique-id="477">Lance has a very bad habit of dropping his eye level when he feels pressure or believes he feels pressure. It’s a young quarterback’s response to defenses. As his eyes drop, he’s not reading down the field and the instinct is to turn into an athlete and a runner when  plays are there to be made downfield if you keep your eyes up, move and reset your throwing window inside the pocket. It was only Lance’s third career start, but  he looked an awful lot like Mitch Trubisky did early in his career when he  would drop his eyes in the face of pressure.</p><p data-reader-unique-id="478" style="font-style: italic;"><span data-reader-unique-id="479">[&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/bears/ct-chicago-bears-devin-hester-hall-of-fame-super-bowl-20220909-h3sxjsdxyjadzhazxwyd7o7bcy-story.html#nt=interstitial-manual" aria-label="Open related story" data-reader-unique-id="480">[Don’t miss] Q&amp;A with Chicago Bears legend Devin Hester: ‘I really wanted to be a first-ballot (Hall of Famer)’</a><span data-reader-unique-id="481">&nbsp;]</span></p><p data-reader-unique-id="482">I won’t pretend to know the dynamics in play for the 49ers, but this was a team that was arguably a dropped interception from reaching the Super Bowl last year. No one says Garoppolo is the long-term answer for the franchise, but he has to be better than Lance right now and if Lance continues to struggle, I have to think it would be a quick hook for the quarterback  the Niners mortgaged  too much for to  move up and draft in 2021.</p><h2 data-reader-unique-id="483">10.
