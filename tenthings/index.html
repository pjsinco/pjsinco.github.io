<p>Is the Chicago Bears’ passing game broken? Brad Biggs’ 10 thoughts on the 27-10 loss to the Green Bay Packers at Lambeau Field.</p>
<p>Sep 19, 2022 at 5:33 am</p>

<p>GREEN BAY — 10 thoughts after the Chicago Bears ran the ball hard — and ran it effectively — while essentially abandoning the passing game in a 27-10 loss to the Green Bay Packers Sunday night at Lambeau Field.</p>

<p>1. I would be surprised if offensive coordinator Luke Getsy doubles down on the call to run Justin Fields from the shotgun formation on fourth-and-goal from inside the 1-yard line.</p>

<p>The Bears called quarterback power with right guard Lucas Patrick pulling on the play, and Fields was stopped short of the goal line with 8:07 remaining in the game and the Bears down two touchdowns. It’s a bad call because it didn’t work. And it’s a bad call because the ball was less than two feet from the goal line.</p>

<p>Getsy doesn’t speak until Thursday, and we’ll get into that decision by him and what the Packers were expecting on the play in a little bit. On a wild Sunday in the NFL with some roller coaster comebacks, I don’t think the Bears were rallying for victory here even if referee Craig Wrolstad ruled it a touchdown, making it a one-score game with half a quarter remaining.</p>

<p>The most important takeaway from Lambeau is a recurring theme. The Bears have a badly flawed offense, especially when it comes to the passing game. While any criticism former Bears offensive coordinator Mike Martz has of Fields and the offense in general may offend many, guess what? Martz is right. Anyone else bagging on the Bears offense is probably right too. The Bears trailed by 17 points at halftime, and came out and attempted five passes in the second half. Yes, some rugged running by David Montgomery and Khalil Herbert was effective — they played particularly well — but you don’t climb back in an NFL game borrowing the Army playbook.</p>

<p>Fields finished 7 of 11 for 70 yards with one interception on his final throw. He was sacked three times. And this time, no one can blame it on the rain and terrible weather conditions. There were two explosive plays in the passing game — a 30-yard shot to Equanimeous St. Brown off a flea flicker on the fourth snap for the offense — and an 18-yard pass across the middle to tight end Ryan Griffin. That’s it. That completes the list of pass plays for the Bears that gained more than 7 yards.</p>

<p>[ [Don’t miss] The Chicago Bears and Green Bay Packers have played 205 times in the past 100 years. Here’s the history of how the rivalry has unfolded each decade. ]</p>

<p>“Luke said before the game that we were going to run it down their throat,” Fields said. “D-Mo, he was running the ball crazy. The O-line did a great job blocking and he did a great job running. My job isn’t to call the plays; my job is to execute the play that is given to me the best I can.”</p>

<p>Fields has completed 15 of 28 passes (53.6%) for 191 yards this season with two touchdowns and two interceptions. That’s known as a pretty bad single game in other cities. Sure, the monsoon contributed to passing game issues in Week 1. But 191 represents the fewest passing yards through the Bears’ first two games since starting QB Kordell Stewart totaled only 240 yards in the first two games of the 2003 season. The next lowest total was in 1993 when the offense mustered 261 passing yards through the first two weeks with Jim Harbaugh.</p>

<p>“I’m not sure what’s missing in the passing game,” Fields said. “I don’t know.”</p>

<p>It’s a super small sample size, but the franchise known for having quarterback issues predating the Super Bowl era is off to a hideous start — even by its own low standards.</p>

<p>Fields lacks poise in the pocket. The ball rarely comes out in rhythm and on time. He’s a young quarterback without a lot of experience and the passing game — two games in — is a mess. It’s also reflective of what we saw in training camp. Fields didn’t complete passes from the pocket with regularity. If routine completions are not happening in practice, they are probably going to be hard to come by in games.</p>

<p>What’s more indictable: Fields’ poor statistics or the fact that the offensive coordinator called only 11 pass attempts?</p>

<p>“On offense, you have to have balance,” coach Matt Eberflus said. “We will look at that as we assess and evaluate the game, but man, the way we were running it ... I mean shoot, we were running it really well and we were still in the game at that point. We were going with what was working for us.”</p>

<p>Former coach Matt Nagy is the convenient villain in this whole situation. Popular thinking was a new system that played to the Fields’ strengths — how many times have you heard that term or a derivative of it? — would fix everything. What are Fields’ strengths as a passer? I don’t know anyone can say at this point and you certainly can’t after this game because the Bears chose not to throw it down three scores. The Bears haven’t had a game where the quarterback completed only seven passes since a bizarre Oct. 22, 2017, victory over the Carolina Panthers when Mitch Trubisky was 4 of 7 for 107 yards.</p>

<p>“For sure, we were expecting them to throw it,” Packers safety Adrian Amos said. “When you’re running the ball, you’re chewing up clock. Yeah, you do expect them to throw a little bit more when they are down by that much.</p>

<p>“I guess they stuck with what they felt was working. They had a couple big runs. We kept them to 10 points.”</p>

<p>I asked Amos, who played for the Bears from 2015-2018, if he could compare Trubisky, his former teammate to Fields.</p>

<p>“I can,” Amos said. “I don’t want to.”</p>

<p>[ [Don’t miss] Week 2 recap: Chicago Bears lose 27-10 to the Green Bay Packers — their 7th straight defeat in the rivalry ]</p>

<p>Packers defensive tackle Kenny Clark told me the Bears didn’t try to throw the ball because they couldn’t keep Fields upright.</p>

<p>“He was getting hit,” Clark said. “Every time they tried to pass it, he was getting hit unless it was a screen. He was flustered out there. We got after him. We knew we had matchup problems for them upfront. Whenever they did try to drop back and pass and tried to block us, that didn’t work.”</p>

<p>The Bears will have to evaluate their offensive line. But Fields is going to have to be better — substantially better — to give players around him a chance. Wide receiver Darnell Mooney has been targeted five times for two receptions and 4 yards. Tight end Cole Kmet has two targets and nothing else. Wide receiver Byron Pringle, signed to a $4 million, one-year deal, has two targets, one catch and 22 yards.</p>

<p>I understand why Eberflus wants to highlight a positive: running for 180 yards and averaging 6.7 per attempt. That’s a huge day on the ground and a credit to the backs and the linemen. The Bears still lost by 17 points, so what does it mean? The passing game is broken. The Bears have completed 15 passes through two games, the lowest total in the NFL with four teams still to play Monday night.</p>

<p>“I don’t care what the rushing stats are,” one personnel man said. “That’s window dressing. You have to throw the ball to win in this league and do it consistently. They don’t have a competitive offense at this point.”</p>

<p>2. If Luke Getsy was going for the element of surprise on fourth-and-goal from the 1-yard line, he caught the Packers off guard.</p>

<p>They were expecting a run even as the Bears had 13 personnel on the field — running back David Montgomery, wide receivers Darnell Mooney, Dante Pettis and Equanimeous St. Brown, and tight end Cole Kmet. They were not expecting Fields, in the shotgun, to run quarterback power behind pulling right guard Lucas Patrick.</p>

<p>The Bears started the possession on their own 10-yard line and drove 89 yards without completing a single pass. There was a play fake and rollout where Fields tried a deep shot to Mooney, who had single coverage from cornerback Eric Stokes, but that ball was overthrown by a good five yards. Montgomery was humming on the possession, too, hitting holes with more conviction than he did a week ago against the San Francisco 49ers and bouncing off tacklers left and right. The offense got out of a second-and-20 hole when Montgomery busted off a 28-yard gain. On the next snap, Khalil Herbert ran for 27 yards. The Bears were pounding the ball effectively against a Packers defense that was torched a week ago in Minnesota by wide receiver Justin Jefferson. It was first-and-goal from the 10 after a Fields’ scramble.</p>

<p>Montgomery ran twice for two yards, moving the ball to the 6-yard-line. Fields took off scrambling on third down and dove for the pylon, reaching for it with the football in the right corner of the end zone, but not before his knee was down. That set up the pivotal play. Fourth-and-goal from the 1, you’re looking for the best short yardage call on your play sheet. The play you have greatest confidence in.</p>

<p>[ [Don’t miss] Justin Fields’ failed 4th-and-1 play halts the Chicago Bears’ momentum. What the QB had to say about the call — and the replay. ]</p>

<p>“I like it and the coaches like it, and we practiced it and repped it because you outnumber the box,” said coach Matt Eberflus, taking an early at-bat for defending the shotgun run. “You are using your quarterback as a runner and you have an additional blocker, and so you like your numbers in the box there. That is why we called it. It was the best play we had there at the time.”</p>

<p>You also move your ball carrier — Fields in this instance — farther away from the goal line with him in the shotgun. The Bears didn’t even need a full yard here.</p>

<p>Having three wide receivers on the field wasn’t even window dressing for the Packers.</p>

<p>“We knew that they were going to run the ball,” said Packers defensive tackle Jarran Reid, who was credited with an assisted tackle on the fourth-down play. “They had success running the ball on that drive and we knew that they were going to try to punch it in because they had gained a little confidence. QB power? That was definitely a surprise. In my mind, I was expecting them to give it to 32 (Montgomery). But when Fields kept it, we just had to make a play.”</p>

<p>“In the second half, they ran a lot of power and they were motioning to strong and running a lot of stretch,” Packers defensive lineman Kenny Clark said. “So, I kind of expected that in a short yardage situation. Didn’t expect QB power, but we knew they were not going to throw the ball in that situation.”</p>

<p>I understand what Eberflus is saying about the extra blocker, but this play got stacked up and replay reviews on calls like these — when the ball carrier is in a sea of humanity — are difficult to get overturned.</p>

<p>“I saw a touchdown,” Montgomery said. “I was right next to the ball. I wouldn’t expect anything less. We’re not in Soldier Field. Next time we just have to be sure that we put it in.”</p>



<p>One problem with calling power at the goal line is if there is any penetration by the defensive line, the puller — right guard Patrick in this case — can’t get there. The Bears can argue they had their best call, but it didn’t work on a night where pretty much everything else they tried with the running game did work.</p>

<p>3. Khalil Herbert was the more decisive Bears running back in Week 1. But not in Week 2.</p>

<p>Herbert hit the hole with more urgency in the opener. Errors come from snap judgments based on one week, but it looked like you could wonder which back was the best fit for the new scheme.</p>

<p>David Montgomery was electric against the Packers, carrying the ball 15 times for 122 yards (8.1 average). He was quick to the hole. He was difficult to bring down. He bounced off tacklers as well or better than he’s ever done before. He ran violently. He carried the offense on his back.</p>

<p>Montgomery keyed the touchdown drive in the first quarter, accounting for 38 yards before Justin Fields kept the ball around the right side on a three-yard scoring run. Montgomery was hot but the Bears got away from him, and he received only one carry in the second quarter. The Packers outscored the Bears 21-0 in the second quarter and that was really about it.</p>

<p>“The O-line was creating a lot of space throughout the whole game,” Montgomery said. “It was just the flow of the game.”</p>

<p>“David Montgomery is a premier back in this league,” Packers coach Matt LaFleur said. “His ability to break tackles and just how hard he runs is pretty impressive to watch. You have to give him credit because he and I thought the entire team battled for four quarters.”</p>

<p>The Bears used fullback Khari Blasingame more in Week 2. He had 13 snaps by my unofficial count, including eight on the drive that ended inside the 1-yard line. Of course, he was on the sideline for the fourth down try when the Packers were expecting Montgomery.</p>

<p>“It felt good to get these boys loose,” Blasingame said of Montgomery and Herbert. “We had an inside zone that popped. We were hitting the outside zones and getting on their outside linebackers. We were just finishing runs. They ran hard. Credit to Khalil, D-Mo. They ran hard as hell.”</p>

<p>It’s a positive sign and something to keep in mind as the Bears prepare to face the Houston Texans in Week 3. Houston has allowed 326 yards rushing through two games.</p>

<p>4. The Packers’ game plan was no surprise.</p>


<p>Packers running back Aaron Jones scores a touchdown during the second quarter against the Bears at Lambeau Field on Sept. 18, 2022. (Armando L. Sanchez / Chicago Tribune)</p>
<p>They were going to run right at the Bears with Aaron Jones and A.J. Dillon — and that’s precisely what they did, rolling up 203 yards on 38 carries, the second-most rushing attempts in the Matt LaFleur era. The most is 39, which the Packers had in the Week 13 meeting with the Bears at Lambeau Field last season. Jones carried 15 times for 132 yards and Dillon added 61 yards on 18 carries. Like David Montgomery, they were frequently bouncing off would-be tacklers and gaining extra yardage as a result.</p>

<p>“They’ve got a good stable of backs and for us, in practice we are going to have to work on our angles,” Bears defensive tackle Justin Jones said. “They were getting a lot of yards after contact and that was kind of what was hurting us. If we hit them, they have to stop right there. We have to stop the ball carrier on the first hit. As for their run game, it was pretty simple but they are really good at what they do.”</p>

<p>Jones made some impact plays and finished with eight tackles, with five of them as solos. He also made two stops in the backfield and had some stops where the running back was close to 10 yards downfield. That’s a nice hustle play, but when a defensive tackle is making a stop more than five yards beyond the line of scrimmage, it’s usually not a good sign overall for the defense.</p>

<p>[ [Don’t miss] A 2nd-quarter thrashing by the Green Bay Packers reminds the Chicago Bears of their place in a one-sided rivalry ]</p>

<p>It’s notable Matt Eberflus said he thought free safety Eddie Jackson played well in run support. He thought Jackson, who had nine tackles, was sound. But there is a whole lot to clean up as the Bears had difficulty stopping Elijah Mitchell in Week 1 before the 49ers running back went out with a knee injury.</p>

<p>This shouldn’t come as a surprise. The Tampa Two scheme is known for limiting explosive plays in the passing game. One weakness of the scheme — and the Bears are not in a two-high shell every snap — is the run defense with defensive linemen is asked to penetrate and get upfield. I don’t believe Eberflus has the personnel he ultimately wants upfront on defense, and the Bears may have been gassed to a degree because they couldn’t stay on the field when they had the ball.</p>

<p>“I would say the tackling. We have to do a better job,” Eberflus said. “Look at the individual and the technique and break down those ones they did tackle well and those they didn’t do well, leverage, angles, tackling. We call it cupping the ball. We have to do a better job at that. It limits the big plays. You look at Eddie Jackson. He tackled very well. I don’t think he missed one. But if you look at some of the younger guys, they maybe did. They missed a couple. Maybe it was more angles, technique and fundamentals. We have to do a better job.”</p>

<p>5. How do the Bears gush about Darnell Mooney and have him go completely overlooked through two games?</p>


<p>Packers cornerback Rasul Douglas tackles Bears wide receiver Darnell Mooney during the second quarter on Sept. 18, 2022. (Armando L. Sanchez / Chicago Tribune)</p>
<p>General manager Ryan Poles said Mooney was “balling” at the end of preseason and after the 53-man roster was established. But there’s been no concerted effort to get the player they’ve pumped up as their best wide receiver going.</p>

<p>Mooney has five targets, two catches and four yards. If he is one of their best offensive players, they’re doing a poor job of putting him in position to help.</p>

<p>“I think whenever you have adversity, you look at all aspects: touches for players, and how we are distributing the ball,” Matt Eberflus said. “I think that is something we have to look at across the board.”</p>

<p>[ [Don’t miss] Aaron Rodgers says Luke Getsy’s next stop is ‘probably head coach.’ But first Getsy must unlock Justin Fields’ potential and revive the Chicago Bears offense. ]</p>

<p>Quarterback Justin Fields said opponents have taken Mooney away on some plays. The 49ers and Packers weren’t doing anything particularly over-the-top to slow Mooney. Fields isn’t worried about Mooney being upset and Mooney has never struck me as a diva-type player, but I’d be stunned if Mooney isn’t simmering a little bit for not getting opportunities.</p>

<p>“He’s not a selfish guy,” Fields said. “He’s a team guy. If we win every game and he comes out with zero catches, he could care less. He’s not that kind of guy.”</p>

<p>I don’t disagree, but something needs to be done about this.</p>

<p>6. The journey to the NFL has been a shared one for undrafted rookies Jack Sanborn and Jake Tonges.</p>

<p>It’s a winding path for players who don’t hear their names called during the draft. There are long odds against making a roster, and even ascending that mountain doesn’t ensure anything. When a team has only time invested in a player — not a draft pick and substantial guaranteed money — it’s a lot easier to move on.</p>

<p>Sanborn and Tonges met in January when they traveled to Los Gatos, Calif., for pre-combine training. That’s where agent Steve Caric, who represents both players, sends his clients for training at Cal Strength. The players had hotel rooms across the hall from each other and wound up basically spending all day, every day together.</p>

<p>They had a $20 bet on who would run a faster 40-yard dash at the combine. Sanborn ran a 4.73 to win by 0.04. They pushed one another through the process. Both held out hope they would be Day 3 selections, but as the rounds went by, each realized that might not happen.</p>

<p>“Some teams started calling at the end of Round 6, beginning of Round 7, and the Bears were one of those teams,” said Tonges, a tight end from Cal. “They were pretty high on my list of teams I wanted to go to if I went undrafted. So then I called Steve and he said: ‘I think Jack is going to go to the Bears too. You guys are going to have a good time.’”</p>

<p>Sanborn, a linebacker from Wisconsin, had multiple opportunities as well, but the Bears with a new scheme looked like a good place to battle for a roster spot.</p>

<p>“It was really great to have someone to come in with that you knew really well, and it’s been a great experience,” Tonges said. “We’re both lucky enough to still be around.”</p>


<p>Bears tight end Jake Tonges practices Aug. 1, 2022, at Halas Hall. (Brian Cassella / Chicago Tribune)</p>
<p>It was an anxious time for both when cuts to the initial 53-man roster were due Aug. 31.</p>

<p>“I was sitting with Jack in my hotel room and we were waiting to get a call to see what the deal was,” Tonges said. “Basically you’re sitting there hoping your phone doesn’t ring. It got to the point where it was probably 11 a.m., and we said, ‘We’ve got to go get a lift.’ So we came over to the facility to lift.”</p>

<p>Said Sanborn: “We were in the middle of our lift and we’re like, ‘Maybe we made it.’”</p>

<p>Sanborn, who is from Lake Zurich, has offered a few pointers on the area to Tonges, whom he has taken to his hometown twice. They’ve been to a comedy show together but that’s about it.</p>

<p>“Since we’ve been here, it’s been all about football,” Sanborn said. “Not much time for anything else.”</p>

<p>That’s probably a wise approach at this point in their careers. Sanborn can play Chicago-area tour guide in the offseason.</p>

<p>7. The NFL is converging on Bourbonnais again.</p>

<p>No, the Bears are not headed back to Olivet Nazarene University for training camp, which was their summer home from 2002-19. Scouts have put the school on the map this season to see Tigers wide receiver Brian Jenkins, who is a junior on the field but is on track to graduate in the spring with a degree in sports management.</p>

<p>ONU coach Eric Hehman said 15 teams, including the Bears, had been to the school before Saturday’s game, a 34-26 loss to Indiana Wesleyan. Jenkins had five receptions for 142 yards and a touchdown in the loss.</p>

<p>The 6-foot-2, 209-pound Jenkins had six receptions for 127 yards and two touchdowns a week earlier in a loss to Siena Heights. Olivet Nazarene competes in the Mid-States Football Association, an NAIA league. Jenkins had 31 receptions for 625 yards and nine touchdowns last season and ran a hand-timed 4.52-second 40-yard dash when an NFC/combine scout visited the school in March.</p>

<p>How does a potential NFL prospect wind up playing at ONU?</p>

<p>“Brian was a real good high school player at Lafayette Jefferson in Indiana, and it was between us some scholarship schools,” Hehman said. “He liked us. I think it was a culture thing. We got him and he’s been developed. He’s still developing. Last game, we would throw it to him when he wasn’t open and he would catch it. He’s really, really progressed.</p>

<p>“With the transfer portal, colleges are recruiting colleges now. I had six guys play FCS last year that would have had another year or two of eligibility here. We’ve had guys develop and transfer up. None of those guys would have gone (to an FCS school) right out of high school, but they all played.</p>

<p>“We develop guys. We have a good strength program and kids mature. Maybe they’re a little slow or small. We had a lineman come in here at 250 pounds and left at 310 (for a larger program). Brian is a guy that matured. He just works super hard. He’s a captain. High-character guy. He’s not flamboyant. He’s really quiet. Quiet and a captain speaks volumes, I think.”</p>

<p>[ [Don’t miss] ‘NFL Sunday Ticket’ outages affect DirecTV customers for the 2nd straight week ]</p>

<p>While some teammates have moved on, Jenkins didn’t believe changing programs would necessarily boost his stock as a prospect.</p>

<p>“Honestly, I didn’t even think about (the portal),” he said. “I felt like if I would have transferred, it would have been hard for me to get into a new program and learn a new system. I just had my faith in staying here and just keep producing and that would carry me through to see my end goal.”</p>

<p>He realized at the end of last season he could draw attention from the NFL and found out a week before he was timed in the 40 that a scout was coming. Without the time to do any real speed training, he worked on his starts. Since then he has trained and says he has been timed in the 4.4s.</p>

<p>“Being a small-school kid and having these scouts come through has been a blessing to me,” Jenkins said. “I have a year of eligibility after this year. It all depends on how well I do this season. If I feel like I did pretty well and the scouts like what they see on film, after this season I feel confident in my skill and my ability that I can pursue my dreams into the NFL.”</p>

<p>The likely best-case scenario for Jenkins is to be considered as an undrafted free agent. With a good season, he easily could have the opportunity to participate in the Northwestern pro day, which usually draws scouts from almost every NFL team.</p>

<p>8. With COVID-19 restrictions lifted, I was curious if college scouts’ jobs — specifically them being on the road — have changed.</p>


<p>Northwestern coach Pat Fitzgerald, center, watches with Bears general manager Ryan Pace, left, and coach Matt Nagy, during the school's Pro Day on March 9, 2021. (Charles Rex Arbogast)</p>
<p>“Some schools have maintained COVID rules,” one national scout said. “Michigan and Ohio State don’t let you in to watch film anymore. You get there an hour before practice, you talk to who you talk to, you go watch practice and then you leave. I am sure there are more schools like that. Those are the two I am familiar with.</p>

<p>“A lot of other schools will let you watch film, but they don’t necessarily want you there to do that. It’s changed in that way. That is partially because of COVID. I think schools like Michigan and Ohio State, it was a really good excuse to change to a policy they prefer.</p>

<p>“Other than that, not really. I would say most teams have realized that they can have Zoom meetings with their scouts more often, so scouts are not flying to their teams’ headquarters as often to do meetings. That’s fantastic because those meetings over Zoom are equally effective and significantly more efficient from a monetary standpoint for the team and a time standpoint for the scouts who are on the road all the time as it is. Now they can meet productively and see their family 10 more nights a year or whatever it is. That’s significant.”</p>

<p>[ [Don’t miss] Will the Chicago Bears leave Soldier Field for Arlington Heights? Here’s what to know. ]</p>

<p>Said another national scout: “With everything opened up, it’s made the job easier. You can get access to the whole building and you can get background information. The biggest mistakes I have ever made were on character for a kid, just getting lied to. You’re told a kid is a great worker and he’s smart, and you get him and he’s lazy.</p>

<p>“The biggest thing is just getting back in the facilities at the campuses so you can get to who you need to talk to instead of having to do it over the phone or on Zoom when a ton of scouts are on it. Guys are more apt to be willing to talk to you and shoot you straight when you are one on one and it’s someone you have a relationship with and they trust you.”</p>

<p>The second national scout concurred that some teams are choosing to hold some meetings virtually.</p>

<p>“But some teams still like to have the scouts around because then if you have them around, you can put more work on them,” he said. “They bring you in for a meeting and then they say, ‘Well, while you’re here, let’s do this silly-ass project.’</p>

<p>“Some have been doing the October and December meetings with scouts virtually for a while now, pre-COVID. There’s no reason to come in and read your report and talk about a player. Why go sit around for five days when you are only going to be talking for, what, less than half a day? You can be just as productive sitting at home during that meeting. Use the technology. Some teams have relished it. Some are still shying away from it.”</p>

<p>9. Knelt on the floor in the visiting locker room after the game, defensive end Robert Quinn was carefully signing his game jersey.</p>

<p>Where was the jersey headed? Over to the Packers locker room for Aaron Rodgers.</p>

<p>“I consider him a rare breed, so it would definitely be nice (to get a jersey from Rodgers),” Quinn said.</p>

<p>Did they agree to a jersey swap?</p>

<p>“I think so,” Quinn said. “I’ve got a good little collection going: Aaron Donald, Larry Fitzgerald, some of the greats. Seems like just about every quarterback I ask for, they say no. This was the first yes — kind of.”</p>

<p>The “kind of” yes indeed turned into a yes.</p>

<p>“Just sent one over right now,” Rodgers said when I told him about the deal.</p>

<p>10. When I called Miami (Ohio) coach Chuck Martin last week to talk about rookie defensive end Dominique Robinson, he returned my call right after practice Tuesday.</p>

<p>Martin is a Park Forest native and graduated from since-closed Rich East High School in 1986. He has been coaching for nearly three decades. He worked at Grand Valley State from 2000-09, Notre Dame from 2010-13 and has been the head coach of the RedHawks since 2014.</p>

<p>Never in that span had Martin had a player he coached land with the Bears — until this season with Robinson and rookie safety Sterling Weatherford, whom the Bears claimed off waivers from the Indianapolis Colts on Aug. 31. Also, RedHawks wide receiver Jalen Walker is the son of Bears running backs coach David Walker.</p>

<p>“Lifelong Bears fan and I’d never had anybody put on a Bears uniform until this year,” Martin told me. “Finally, I have three guys that I love that are with the Bears. I would be rooting for Dom wherever he went. I have actually been to Soldier Field rooting for the opposition because I had two or three players on the other team, which was really weird for me, but I’ve never not rooted for my guys. Now it’s wonderful.”</p>

They didn’t face a ton of third downs because they were either off the field right away or were running the ball so well they moved the chains on first or second down.

The Bears beat Smith and the Bucs 26-21 on Dec. 27, 2015, in Tampa, Fla., on a two-touchdown day for running back Ka’Deem Carey. Those were the only two touchdowns of Carey’s career.

<p>10 thoughts after the Chicago Bears rallied in the second half to open the season with a 19-10 victory over the San Francisco 49ers in sloppy conditions at Soldier Field.</p>

<p>1. The new men in charge of the football side for the Bears earned game balls.</p>


<p>Bears coach Matt Eberflus celebrates the Week 1 win at Soldier Field on Sept. 11, 2022. (Brian Cassella / Chicago Tribune)</p>
<p>That’s fitting after the Bears grinded out a victory in less-than-ideal conditions and on better-than-usual turf. Can you imagine what a previous surface would have looked like after a game with that much rain?</p>

<p>It wasn’t pretty, and the first half, at least offensively, was downright ugly. Everyone has seen more than their share of 30-minute starts in which the Bears offense was unable to reach the end zone.</p>

<p>The 49ers did a good job of winning the field-position battle through two quarters, but despite controlling the action, they couldn’t get a big cushion on the scoreboard. The Bears played with an uncommon level of poise for such a young roster. They had 11 rookies on the active game-day roster, one first-year player (reserve center Dieter Eiselen, who was flexed up from the practice squad) and six second-year players. That’s 18 of the 47 players in uniform, a huge number of young players.</p>

<p>But it was the 49ers who made the kind of mistakes you see young teams make. They committed 12 penalties for 99 yards — many of them costly mistakes in a close game — and the Bears finished plus-1 in turnover margin with free safety Eddie Jackson making his first interception since 2019 and cornerback Jaylon Johnson punching the ball out of Deebo Samuel’s clutch at the Bears 12-yard line before rookie strong safety Jaquan Brisker fell on it.</p>

<p>[ [Sign up now] Be the first to read Brad Biggs’ 10 thoughts on the Chicago Bears each week ]</p>

<p>The points coach Matt Eberflus has been driving home from day one in his comments to the media and to his players were measures that his team played with.</p>

<p>“We always tell the guys, ‘Hey, we have mental and physical stamina for what reason?’” Eberflus said. “And it’s because of the way we practice and the way we play, and we’re able to stay focused when it is the second half, in those critical moments, and they can play and be focused in those moments. So that was really good.”</p>

<p>Chairman George McCaskey entered the locker room shortly after the game, which I can’t recall seeing him do in the past. Maybe it was to congratulate the general manager, Ryan Poles, and coach he hired in January. Maybe it was to take in the scene of a jubilant locker room. Maybe it was for some unrelated reason. Whatever the case, it was interesting.</p>

<p>So, too, were McCaskey’s comments Friday in a wide-ranging interview that included team President Ted Phillips that Tribune beat writer Colleen Kane was part of. McCaskey was asked how he will measure success for the team this season with the Bears beginning a rebuilding process.</p>

<p>[ [Don’t miss] Chicago Bears Week 1 notes: A penalty for using a towel, rookie standouts — and what happened to the Bear Raid siren? ]</p>

<p>“Wins are always a gauge of success and progress,” McCaskey said. “Beyond that, I’d like to see some of the themes that Matt has been emphasizing — discipline, smart play, hustle, swarming defense, takeaways, going for the ball. Three-and-outs. Getting the run game going. Minimizing mistakes. And learning from mistakes. He talks about getting better each week. That’s a good gauge.”</p>

<p>Run through that checklist — a list that makes sense — and the Bears were the better team in every phase Sunday against a quality opponent that played in the NFC championship game not long after the Bears finalized the hirings of Poles and Eberflus.</p>

<p>[ [Don’t miss] George McCaskey doesn’t ‘anticipate any change in the structure’ as the Chicago Bears look for a new team president. But will it be a ‘football person’ this time? ]</p>

<p>The ground game wasn’t great and the 49ers did a good job of corraling David Montgomery (17 rushes for 26 yards), but offensive coordinator Luke Getsy remained committed to it and the offensive line provided some cracks in the second half that Khalil Herbert took advantage of.</p>

<p>Mix in some nice runs by Justin Fields on scrambles, the busted 51-yard touchdown pass to Dante Pettis and a nice decision and throw for a touchdown on third-and-2 from the 49ers 19-yard line, and the Bears came up with a formula for victory. Niners quarterback Trey Lance was battered and looked skittish way too often, dropping his eyes in the pocket.</p>

<p>Eberflus talked about a 24-hour rule — and that’s in every coach’s playbook. Enjoy the victory and then be prepared to report to work Monday and turn the page to the next opponent. One thing is for sure, it’s a lot easier to coach corrections coming off a victory than it is a loss.</p>

<p>“We’ve got a lot of young players on our squad (and) they need to take what they have learned from this game and get better,” Eberflus said. “Good, bad or indifferent, they have to get better. And our individual (practice period) on Wednesday will reflect that. Whatever they’re working on, we’re going to have a good 15, 20 minutes of individual (time) to work on the fundamentals because that’s what wins football games. That’s going to be a big part of what we do here as coaches as we make these corrections from this game.”</p>

<p>This might sound like straight coachspeak and come across as a little monotonous, but it’s something Eberflus has referenced before and it’s worth explaining here. He is willing to sacrifice snaps in team periods — 11-on-11 football — to make sure his players are dialed in on technique. It’s something that Eberflus believes in and that the Bears will stick with weekly.</p>

<p>2. It took the kind of special, off-script play Justin Fields can make with his rare athletic ability for the Bears to get rolling.</p>


<p>Bears quarterback Justin Fields scrambles in the third quarter on Sept. 11, 2022, at Soldier Field. (Brian Cassella / Chicago Tribune)</p>
<p>Before we get into the 51-yard touchdown pass to Dante Pettis, it’s important to note the defense did its part. The 49ers led 7-0 when they got the ball to start the third quarter. Jauan Jennings got free behind rookie cornerback Kyler Gordon for a 44-yard gain on third-and-6, and pretty soon they had first-and-goal at the 5-yard line.</p>

<p>A touchdown there would have created what looked like an insurmountable lead given the way the first half went on offense. Roquan Smith stopped Jeff Wilson for a 3-yard gain on first down. Jaquan Brisker dropped Wilson for a 2-yard loss on the next play, and Smith and rookie defensive end Dominique Robinson — more on him in a bit — combined to sack Trey Lance on third down, forcing a 25-yard Robbie Gould field goal.</p>

<p>The Bears got some nice breaks on the ensuing possession that led to the Pettis score. First, 49ers linebacker Dre Greenlaw was penalized 15 yards for a facemask infraction after a run for no gain by David Montgomery on third-and-4. That’s a punt there without the penalty.</p>

<p>On the next snap, former Bears safety Tashaun Gipson dropped a potential interception on a pass to the boundary to Equanimeous St. Brown. Montgomery ran for no gain, and it was third-and-10 from the Bears 49-yard line with the Niners in Cover-3.</p>

<p>Pettis was running an in-breaking route on the back side and Darnell Mooney was attempting to clear the middle of the field by running a seam route. Fields had a check-down to tight end Cole Kmet early in the play. It’s a decision Fields could have made — get Kmet the ball and see if he can break a tackle to move the chains.</p>

<p>Fields’ eyes were downfield when he felt pressure. Nick Bosa and Arik Armstead ran a twist/stunt from a tilted front designed to create one-on-ones. Bosa slanted inside and Armstead went upfield. Left tackle Braxton Jones eventually dropped his head, and Bosa did a quick arm-over to apply pressure. That’s when Fields spun out.</p>

<p>[ [Don’t miss] Justin Fields’ Slip ‘N Slide celebration — ‘a snapshot moment’ — caps the Chicago Bears’ wild, wet comeback win ]</p>

<p>“I honestly didn’t see where (Fields) was when I turned around,” Pettis said. “I saw everybody flowing that way so I figured he was over there, but I couldn’t see what was going on. All of a sudden it kind of opened up a little bit and I saw him stand up to throw.”</p>

<p>By then, the underneath curl defender, Greenlaw, had vacated the space. He had no idea Pettis was behind him and when he saw Montgomery move to the middle of the field, he pursued Montgomery. There was no one left for the 49ers as cornerback Charvarius Ward left to take Mooney on the seam route. Safety Talanoa Hufanga came down as a hook defender and was just running around.</p>

<p>There was no one within 30 yards of Pettis, and if the Niners are going to blame anyone, it’s probably Greenlaw. He has to find someone to plaster and realize there could be a player behind him.</p>

<p>“Normally, no one throws it back across the field like that,” Pettis said. “I think everyone just flowed with Justin when he rolled out, completely just forgot about me and left me alone, disregarded (me). Whatever it was.”</p>

<p>Pettis waved his arms as if he were stranded on a beach and wanted to get the attention of a plane flying overhead.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t believe (how open I was),” he said. “I literally looked around for a second and I was like, ‘I really am this open.’ Normally there is someone behind you.”</p>

<p>Pettis said there are basic rules to follow on broken plays when it turns into backyard football. Nothing sophisticated. See if you can find an open space where the quarterback can get you the ball.</p>

<p>[ [Don’t miss] Soldier Field resodded with Bermuda grass — replacing the old Kentucky bluegrass. The Chicago Bears hope it’s stronger, faster and safer. ]</p>

<p>“It’s more like guidelines,” Pettis said. “Every team has them. They’re like general scramble rules. If you’re the low receiver, you go high. If you’re the high receiver, you go low. Or if you are low, you push up a couple yards and break back down. You normally don’t try to work back across the field to the quarterback.</p>

<p>“Those are just generic rules that everybody basically goes by. I don’t know if it was from playing basketball or something, (but) being able to find spaces is relatively easy for me. Being able to feel that space.”</p>

<p>St. Brown was able to make a key block as Pettis neared the end zone, and it turned into a huge play for an offense that had mustered only 74 yards on its first 33 snaps.</p>

<p>“Even after that play we’re still up and we’ve got full control,” 49ers linebacker Fred Warner said. “We just kept shooting ourselves in the foot with bad penalties. What was it — 100 yards (actually 99) in penalties? That’s not winning football. We were minus-1 in turnovers. Those things will always hold up forever in ball.”</p>

<p>[ [Don’t miss] Q&A with George McCaskey and Ted Phillips: On search for new Chicago Bears president, potential stadium in Arlington Heights and much more ]</p>

<p>The 49ers might have felt like they remained in total control with a 10-7 lead, but that slipped quickly. At the end of the third quarter, the Bears started a possession on their 16 and Fields immediately hooked up with Byron Pringle for a 22-yard pass along the sideline. The 49ers would have gotten off the field after stopping Fields on a third-and-9 run that gained 5 yards, but Ward was called for holding, another costly penalty.</p>

<p>A second roughing call against Fields, this one on linebacker Azeez Al-Shaair, gave the Bears another 15 yards, and pretty soon Fields hit St. Brown for an 18-yard touchdown when the Niners blew coverage on St. Brown and Pringle, leaving both wide open. With 12:45 to play, the Bears led 13-10 and the momentum the Niners had for the majority of the game was gone.</p>

<p>“We always talk about doing right longer,” 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan said. “Today was the exact opposite. Looking at the amount of penalties we had compared to them, the turnovers compared to them and then the timing of those penalties were crucial. We’re real disappointed.”</p>

<p>3. The biggest storyline for the Bears this season will be the development of Justin Fields.</p>


<p>Bears quarterback Justin Fields celebrates a touchdown pass in the fourth quarter on Sept. 11, 2022, at Soldier Field. (Brian Cassella / Chicago Tribune)</p>
<p>But there is a roster full of young players and their improvement is essential for the organization to take the next step. General manager Ryan Poles and his staff have a host of questions at a lot of positions, and the more that can be answered this season, the better positioned the roster will be.</p>

<p>Credit rookie left tackle Braxton Jones with a solid first outing. Yes, he surrendered a sack to Nick Bosa — who spent more time lining up over the right side than he did over Jones — but Bosa is the kind of talent who will get his wins against the best linemen.</p>

<p>“It didn’t feel incredibly different,” Jones said of his regular-season debut. “Obviously a lot better players when you’re playing the starters. It might have felt faster, but at the end of the day it felt normal for me.</p>

<p>“I’ve got to clean up some stuff. We came out with a win. Fought through some adversity. A tough first half obviously. I am just glad we came out with the win and got a team victory.”</p>

<p>Bosa got into Jones pretty quickly on the sack and then converted speed to power, and the play was over soon as Fields went down.</p>

<p>[ [Don’t miss] ‘You can see the hunger.’ What drives Justin Fields to change perceptions of the Chicago Bears offense in the QB’s 2nd season? ]</p>

<p>“It was a very normal rush for Nick Bosa, I would say,” Jones said. “It was a very bad rep on my part. I felt like I was a little bit late, whereas he was right on time. It was a bad set. I let him get in my chest and it was kind of over from there. The biggest thing on that, the thing I took to heart, was don’t let one turn into two or three. Just come back and keep on grinding.”</p>

<p>Jones glanced up at the video board after Fields got off the ground to confirm what went wrong.</p>

<p>“It was just bad technique,” he said. “That’s not me. Coach told me to just go out there and trust your training. That’s what I started to do. Still a lot to clean up, but I was getting a good feel for it.”</p>

<p>As the second half unfolded and the Bears were able to find modest success running the ball with Khalil Herbert, Jones gained a little bit of confidence, too, in mushy conditions that probably negated some of the pass rush.</p>

<p>“That’s what we want to do,” Jones said. “That’s our identity. We want to ground and pound. What I said to myself was it wasn’t going to be won in the first, second, third quarters. It’s going to be won in all four, so just keep grinding them and I knew they were going to whimper down before they would come out on top. We just kept grinding on them, and as you could see toward the end, they couldn’t take much more.”</p>

<p>4. How about fellow rookie Dominique Robinson?</p>


<p>Dominique Robinson sacks 49ers QB Trey Lance during the first half on Sept. 11, 2022, at Soldier Field. (Charles Rex Arbogast/AP)</p>
<p>He was out of practice after the preseason finale in Cleveland with a minor right knee injury but returned last week. He played 29 snaps by my unofficial count and made the most of them with 1½ sacks.</p>

<p>Excluding the strike portion of the 1987 season — the Bears had an 11-sack game in a 35-3 victory over Buddy Ryan and the Philadelphia Eagles on Oct. 4 of that year — it’s the most sacks in a season opener for a Bears rookie. Six other rookies had one sack in their debut, most recently Roquan Smith in 2018 in Green Bay.</p>

<p>Robinson picked up his first sack in the first quarter when the Niners had third-and-7 on the Bears 29-yard line, meaning they were in range for a Robbie Gould field goal. Right tackle Mike McGlinchey overset slightly, opening an inside path to the backfield.</p>

<p>Robinson used a violent swipe with his hands to defeat McGlinchey and then a quick inside move. McGlinchey held him, too, though officials didn’t make the call. Then Robinson took down the 6-foot-4, 224-pound Trey Lance with one arm.</p>

<p>“I took my two steps up the field and he was past my eyes,” Robinson said. “I went inside and made a play. I knew at some point something was going to open up, whether it would be on the outside or inside.”</p>

<p>[ [Don’t miss] Chicago Bears’ plans for stadium in Arlington Heights excite many suburbanites — but with funding a big issue, economists caution about subsidies ]</p>

<p>On the combo sack of Lance, which Robinson shared with Smith, he didn’t even know he got partial credit.</p>

<p>It has to be good for the Bears to see the traits that attracted them to Robinson — a raw pass rusher whom Miami (Ohio) really used only in sub packages last season — showing up at the outset of the season. He’s a converted college wide receiver and originally arrived at college as a quarterback, the position he played in high school.</p>

<p>Before that?</p>

<p>“I’ve been bouncing around my whole life,” Robinson said. “I started as a running back. I played running back and safety.”</p>

<p>Robinson has a lot of improving to do to become a well-rounded defensive end. The Bears will play to his strengths for now and see where it takes him.</p>

<p>“He’s a talented player and you see the shiftiness and quickness to him,” defensive end Robert Quinn said. “When he’s out there, he’s making plays. As he grows and understands the game more and becomes more confident — and I don’t want to speak for him — he is going to set his own ceiling. As everyone saw today, he’s got some playmaking ability.”</p>

<p>5. The Bears can get a big boost on defense if the most experienced member of their secondary, free safety Eddie Jackson, returns to form.</p>


<p>Bears safety Eddie Jackson celebrates his interception in the fourth quarter on Sept. 11, 2022, at Soldier Field. (Brian Cassella / Chicago Tribune)</p>
<p>He would admit he hasn’t been at his best the last two seasons. But the coaching staff has offered him a clean slate with no preconceived notions.</p>

<p>Jackson seems to have adopted a fresh attitude too — not just something that shows up in a news conference but a genuine realization that this is a big opportunity for him. He has a lucrative contract and needs to perform to maintain it.</p>

<p>[ [Don’t miss] Preparation and perseverance pay off for the Chicago Bears defense in a Week 1 shocker: ‘No one works harder than us’ ]</p>

<p>His interception of Trey Lance in the fourth quarter pretty much put the game away. The 49ers were nearing midfield on third-and-5 from their 41-yard line, and the Bears were in Cover-1 robber. They added a low hole dropper, having a defensive tackle drop out with only a three-man rush. They had two inside defenders to take away in-breaking routes — what you want to do in that situation against the 49ers, who often look for tight end George Kittle (who missed the game with a groin injury).</p>

<p>Jackson rotated down as a robber and put his eyes on Lance. That took him right to the play, which was intended for wide receiver Jauan Jennings. Credit to Jackson for seeing it, recognizing the play and getting a jump on the pass, but an inexperienced quarterback took him there as well.</p>

<p>[ Column: Matt Eberflus’ defense was the NFL’s toughest on 3rd down last year, one scout says. What will that mean for the Chicago Bears this season?[Don’t miss]  ]</p>

<p>“Just trying to give him different looks,” Jackson said. “That’s really just a young quarterback. Year 2, didn’t play a lot last year, so just trying to get him to do something different that he’s not comfortable with, trying to get him to drop back and throw the ball and go through his reads.</p>

<p>“We knew that when they get in those stacks, they like to (run) a two-option play. So we saw tight end and just played (Lance’s) eyes.”</p>

<p>Just like that, Jackson had his first interception since the season finale of 2019. Think about that. A lot happened in the world between those interceptions. Jackson returned the pick 26 yards to the San Francisco 21-yard line to set up the final touchdown.</p>

<p>6. The Bears created a little momentum in the running game in the second half, and the best run came on the play after Eddie Jackson’s interception.</p>


<p>Bears running back Khalil Herbert scores a touchdown in the fourth quarter on Sept. 11, 2022, at Soldier Field. (Brian Cassella / Chicago Tribune)</p>
<p>Khalil Herbert went for 10 yards on first down on a simple inside zone play. Tight end Cole Kmet blocked down on defensive end Nick Bosa. He missed Bosa with his cut block but slowed him a little, and a really nice combination block by right tackle Larry Borom and right guard Teven Jenkins made the play happen.</p>

<p>Left guard Cody Whitehair took care of a defensive tackle, allowing center Sam Mustipher to climb to the second level, but it was the initial combo by Borom and Jenkins at the point of attack that made the play happen.</p>

<p>Herbert is a good fit for what the Bears want to do offensively. He’s decisive, he gets north and south immediately and he’s a physical runner. Right now, he’s a little more urgent than David Montgomery in terms of getting his pads downhill and going. Will this affect playing time moving forward? We’re talking about a very small sample size, but it’s something to think about in the weeks ahead.</p>

<p>[ [Don’t miss] ‘We’ve all bought in’: How the Chicago Bears hope to reset expectations this season with a ‘new normal’ in how they prepare ]</p>

<p>Even modest success for the offensive line should be a nice boost for a group that has faced a lot of questions.</p>

<p>“They stuck with it,” Mustipher said. “They kept trusting us. We didn’t get into a drop-back fest. That last takeaway the defense got for us put us in good position, and it was like, ‘We’re going to run it.’ Here’s our opportunity to make something happen, which is awesome. There are some plays we want back, some ones that got stuffed. They trusted us, which is really cool.</p>

<p>“San Francisco’s front seven is arguably one of the best in the league. That was a good deal.”</p>

<p>7. Lesson learned for rookie punter Trenton Gill.</p>


<p>Bears punter Trenton Gill leaves the field through a puddle on Sept. 11, 2022, at Soldier Field. (Brian Cassella / Chicago Tribune)</p>
<p>He brought a large towel from the sideline to mop up the large puddle where he planned to put the ball down for a 47-yard field-goal attempt by Cairo Santos at the end of the second quarter.</p>

<p>The Bears drew an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty as rules prohibit the use of a foreign object — basically anything that isn’t part of the uniform — to do a little groundskeeping in the driving rain.</p>

<p>“You cannot bring what we consider a foreign object — this was not a towel that would go on a uniform — out to alter the playing surface,” referee Clay Martin said in a press release. “We felt that provided an unfair advantage, using the towel to wipe down the area where the ball was going to be placed.</p>

<p>“If he used it to wipe his hands and had thrown it away, we would have been OK with it. To put it on the ground and alter the playing surface where we were going to spot the ball, that’s why we called a penalty.”</p>

<p>[ [Don’t miss] Will the Chicago Bears leave Soldier Field? Here’s what to know about the team’s possible move to Arlington Heights. ]</p>

<p>Gill said he wasn’t aware of the rule.</p>

<p>“I know never to do it again,” he said. “I had never done it before. But I’ve never played in a game before when it’s been rain the whole time, a couple inches on the field. There was about 2 inches of water on the field, so it was definitely a hard thing to do.”</p>

<p>The standing water gave problems to Santos as well. He missed two extra points.</p>

<p>“Every time I planted, my foot was sinking in standing water,” Santos said. “So it was challenging. It’s my job to execute and I didn’t do that. I am disappointed in how my kicks went. It’s not how I envisioned it based on how the warm-ups went. I thought I handled that good. Sometimes it’s like that and I’ve got to bounce back.</p>

<p>“The quality of the grass is great. I was really happy to see that. Getting a lot of rain just made it hard. Kicking on standing water. I didn’t handle that like I thought I would based on the pregame warm-ups. I’ve just got to bounce back.”</p>

<p>8. The Bears’ decision to place a waiver claim on Alex Leatherwood after the Las Vegas Raiders made him part of their final cuts was interesting.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for a reason to believe the Bears could have a young player who might turn into something, you have to go beyond the fact Leatherwood was highly drafted. The Raiders reached by selecting him with the 17th pick in 2021.</p>

<p>The Bears feel like they have quality scouting reports on Leatherwood. Assistant offensive line coach Austin King was the Raiders tight ends coach last season. Defensive line coach Travis Smith was the Raiders assistant defensive line coach. So the Bears had two assistants to turn to for an evaluation of what Leatherwood was like on the practice field and inside the facility.</p>

<p>The tape? It wasn’t good. In fact, it was bad. Leatherwood started all 17 regular-season games last season. He struggled mightily at right tackle in the first four games and was moved inside to guard with the hope he wouldn’t be as exposed there. Guards Richie Incognito and Denzelle Good suffered injuries, so as much as the Raiders wanted to, they couldn’t remove Leatherwood from the lineup.</p>

<p>“The thing that was hard to explain is how a player that is such a good athlete could wind up in such a bad position so regularly,” said one source with knowledge of Leatherwood’s rookie season. “It’s like he struggled instinctively. I don’t know how else to explain it, but this kid went through 17 games and didn’t get any better.”</p>

<p>The other factor to consider here is offensive line coach Chris Morgan considers Tom Cable, the Raiders offensive line coach last season, one of his two biggest mentors in the NFL. So it’s fair to assume Morgan did due diligence with Cable when the Bears discussed the possibility of claiming Leatherwood and inheriting a rookie contract that carries through the 2024 season and includes $5.9 million in guarantees.</p>

<p>If Leatherwood turns into a player — even a rank-and-file starter — for the Bears at some point, it will be a modest investment. And with the Bears having a ton of salary-cap room looking ahead to 2023, it’s not like the risk of taking on the contract of a player who really struggled as a rookie would set the team back. Sure, the Bears could have decided not to claim Leatherwood and then attempted to sign him as a free agent, but there might have been competition for him at that point.</p>

<p>The Bears have been working Leatherwood at right tackle with the reserves, but I wouldn’t read too much into that. They’re getting him up to speed with the playbook. Maybe they will seriously look at him as a right tackle in the future. Perhaps they’ll decide he would be better inside at guard, or it’s possible factors with existing linemen dictate where he goes. For the time being, they’re getting him adjusted to the playbook and how they want to practice, and that can be a challenge as teams are allowed to practice with full pads only once per week during the regular season.</p>

<p>Leatherwood has spoken to reporters once since he arrived and said he’s not really concerned about what went wrong in Las Vegas.</p>

<p>“I’m more concerned with the future and the things that I’ve got going on here now,” he said.</p>

<p>Leatherwood and the Bears should be concerned about what didn’t go right a year ago so both parties can avoid those pitfalls. If he had shown improvement in the spring and summer, I don’t think a new regime for the Raiders would have looked to trade him so quickly and then cut him. Learning from past mistakes is the best way to avoid repeating them.</p>

<p>There’s no timeline to get him on the field. This is a long play with him being under contract for two more years after this season. Maybe he’ll get to the point this season where he’s ready for action, and perhaps that would coincide with a need on the line. There’s no way of telling.</p>

<p>“Alex has done a great job so far with us,” Morgan said. “He’s working really hard. He’s done a heck of a job connecting with the guys. We’re glad to have him. ‘Embrace everything and let’s roll.’ It’s really an easy message (for him).”</p>

<p>It will be interesting to see how things unfold on the line over the course of the season. Teven Jenkins and Lucas Patrick rotated at right guard throughout Sunday’s game. How that position will be handled next week remains to be seen. At some point do the Bears want to evaluate Leatherwood?</p>

<p>The Bears drafted four offensive linemen in April. Doug Kramer was placed on season-ending injured reserve. There are three second-year players in Jenkins, Larry Borom and Leatherwood. How many of these young guys will the coaching staff feel it has a good handle on by the end of the year?</p>

<p>9. Watch an ugly game like that and you immediately wonder how long it will be before 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan turns to Jimmy Garoppolo.</p>

<p>Trey Lance’s performance was pretty brutal as he completed 13 of 28 passes for 164 yards with the Eddie Jackson interception. He’s athletic but he didn’t hurt the Bears pulling the ball down and running like Justin Fields did to the 49ers.</p>

<p>Lance has a very bad habit of dropping his eye level when he feels pressure or believes he feels pressure. It’s a young quarterback’s response to defenses. As his eyes drop, he’s not reading down the field and the instinct is to turn into an athlete and a runner when plays are there to be made downfield if you keep your eyes up, move and reset your throwing window inside the pocket. It was only Lance’s third career start, but he looked an awful lot like Mitch Trubisky did early in his career when he would drop his eyes in the face of pressure.</p>

<p>I won’t pretend to know the dynamics in play for the 49ers, but this was a team that was arguably a dropped interception from reaching the Super Bowl last year. No one says Garoppolo is the long-term answer for the franchise, but he has to be better than Lance right now and if Lance continues to struggle, I have to think it would be a quick hook for the quarterback the Niners mortgaged too much for to move up and draft in 2021.</p>

<p>10. The Indianapolis Colts struck a deal with All-Pro guard Quenton Nelson on Saturday night.</p>

<p>The sides agreed to a four-year, $80 million extension that reportedly includes $60 million guaranteed and resets the market for interior offensive linemen. This is worth mentioning because Nelson was a member of the 2018 draft class that produced linebacker Roquan Smith. The Bears would have loved a chance to draft Nelson, the Notre Dame product who was selected at No. 6, two spots before Smith. Remember, Nelson’s college position coach, Harry Hiestand, was on the Bears staff at the time.</p>

<p>Nelson is the 10th player selected in the top 24 picks in 2018 to sign a contract extension, following Cleveland Browns cornerback Denzel Ward (No. 4 pick), Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen (No. 7), Pittsburgh Steelers safety Minkah Fitzpatrick (No. 11, acquired from the Miami Dolphins via trade), Tampa Bay Buccaneers defensive tackle Vita Vea (No. 12), Raiders left tackle Kolton Miller (No. 15), Los Angeles Chargers safety Derwin James (No. 17), Green Bay Packers cornerback Jaire Alexander (No. 18), Detroit Lions center Frank Ragnow (No. 20) and Carolina Panthers wide receiver D.J. Moore (No. 24).</p>

<p>10b. Four state schools have players on the Senior Bowl watch list, a preliminary group being evaluated for invitations to the all-star game. There are a whopping 484 names on the list, and that doesn’t include specialists. Here are the players from Illinois schools plus Notre Dame:</p>

<p>Illinois (4): RB Chase Brown, S Sydney Brown, TE Luke Ford, CB Devon Witherspoon</p>
<p>Northern Illinois (2): QB Rocky Lombardi, OL Nolan Potter</p>
<p>Northwestern (1): DL Adetomiwa Adebawore</p>
<p>Notre Dame (3): WR Braden Lenzy, OL Josh Lugg, OL Jarrett Patterson</p>
<p>Southern Illinois (1): FB Javon Williams Jr.</p>
<p>10c. You probably didn’t hear it, but Matt Eberflus thanked head groundskeeper Ken Mrock last week for his work and Mrock probably should be commended for how the surface at Soldier Field held up during Sunday’s game. Maybe the new Bermuda grass surface didn’t drain as well as anyone would have liked, but there weren’t divots and chunks of turf flying up.</p>

<p>Everyone who was bent out of shape with the condition of the field during the preseason can rest a little easier if this new surface holds up. So kudos to Mrock and the park district staff.</p>

<p>10d. The Packers opened as nine-point favorites over the Bears for Sunday night’s game at Lambeau Field (7:20 p.m., NBC-5).</p>
